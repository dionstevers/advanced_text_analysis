2020-01-23,Wuhan Coronavirus,a433.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/11592,Sharon Hodgson,Labour,Shadow Minister (Public Health),0,"I thank the Secretary of State for an advance copy of his statement, and for updating the House this morning.
The coronavirus is indeed very concerning, and I am grateful for the work of Public Health England and the Department on it so far, especially in screening passengers on direct flights from Wuhan.
However, a passenger arriving from Wuhan yesterday said that he had gone through virtually no screening, but was given a leaflet.
Does the Secretary of State have any response to that?
Will flights from other Chinese cities, not just Wuhan, be monitored, and when does the Minister think monitoring might begin?
Will there be specific traveller advice for UK citizens travelling into China who have existing conditions that may mean they need to take more care?
As the Minister said, Public Health England has assessed the risk of the coronavirus being spread to the UK as “low”.
In the event of the virus spreading to the UK, are there contingency plans and funds to prevent further spreading, to deal with the scale of the problem?
As the Minister knows, we are in the middle of flu season, so I do not want to cause any undue anxiety, especially as—as we have heard—there are no cases in the UK at the moment, but can he please advise people watching who may be concerned about their own symptoms of what they should do?
We all know that the NHS has a tremendous record in responding to similar incidents, such as Ebola and monkeypox.
We can certainly be proud of our public health record in these areas and can be confident in how public health bodies will respond to this incident.
There is a chance that a global pandemic can be avoided if Governments across the world take the right measures in a timely fashion.
I thank the Minister for his update today, and would be grateful if he could provide some further clarity on all the points I have raised.",600

Shutting down a city the size of London as it prepares to celebrate Chinese new year is an extraordinary undertaking.
What support has the international community offered to the Chinese authorities, particularly the health services, as they cope with this unprecedented strain on resources?
Some of my questions have already been asked, so I will just ask about the World Health Organisation, which is meeting today.
What communication have the UK Government had with the WHO?
Can the Secretary of State assure the House that the Government will remain updated, in real time, on developments and on what steps, if any, are required in the UK?
Finally, I have a number of Chinese constituents, as we probably all have, and English is difficult for many of them.
When we give information to Chinese communities in the UK, is it provided in different languages?",431

Sadly, the news of this outbreak could not have come at a worse time, as residents are preparing to celebrate the lunar new year.
What more can the Secretary of State do, in light of our expertise in coronaviruses, to support the Chinese Government?
We have a sizeable Chinese community in Manchester, so we should raise awareness in this country.",146

We know that scientists are already working hard to find a vaccine for this newly identified strain of coronavirus.
Given the importance of vaccines in combating serious diseases such as this, does he agree that education about vaccines is more important than ever in this age of disinformation?
What conversations has he had with colleagues to combat fake news on vaccines?",193

Throughout the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, people like you and me, Mr Speaker—you are a type 1 diabetic and I am a type 2 diabetic—have a chronic disease.
Those who are diabetic and many others across the United Kingdom worry about the killer impact of this virus.
I note that the United States of America has diverted flights to specific screening areas.
I am sure that the Minister and many others in the House saw the news this morning, as I did.
On the flight that arrived this morning, there were three different opinions among those coming off the plane: one said that they had had no advice or discussion whatsoever; the second one got a leaflet; and the third one said that they had some tests done before they left China.
So it seems that mixed messages are coming out.
It is important that we have a clear policy and that everyone flying here and every person here feels assured.",691
2020-02-03,Wuhan Coronavirus,c42.1,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25120,Jon Ashworth,Labour,Shadow Secretary of State for Health,0,"I am grateful to the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement, for the way in which he has kept the House updated, and for making arrangements for the chief medical officer, NHS England officials and Public Health England officials to keep me updated.
Our thoughts are naturally with those who have lost their lives and those who have contracted the virus, including the two cases mentioned by the Secretary of State.
I thank our NHS staff, who once again show themselves to be exceptional and dedicated.
I pay tribute to our world-leading expertise at Public Health England and NHS England.
I also join the Secretary of State in putting on record our thanks to all those involved in returning British nationals from Wuhan.
Will he tell the House whether it is the Government’s intention to return all remaining British nationals in China, and whether there will be more Foreign and Commonwealth Office chartered flights in the coming days?
I agree with the Secretary of State that we must remain vigilant and alert, and not succumb to alarmism or scaremongering.
As things stand, the virus has a mortality rate of around 2%.
That is certainly significant but, as he says, most people will recover.
However, the virus is highly infectious.
The pathogen appears to be easily transmitted.
Cases have now been reported in over 20 countries.
The epidemic has grown at a pace quite unprecedented in recent history, with the official case count more than tripling in the past week.
I welcome the Secretary of State’s remarks about the G7.
He will be aware, of course, that we have seen cases in countries such as Cambodia, Nepal and the Philippines that have weaker health systems than ours.
What work is he carrying out with the Secretary of State for International Development to support countries around the world that will need extra help at this time?
I welcome the Secretary of State’s £20 million for vaccine research,
, but we have to recognise that, even if a vaccine is produced, it is probably some months away.
Therefore, slowing down the virus spread while that vaccine is developed is absolutely crucial.
So how many people has Public Health England now contacted who have been in touch with the two people who were infected?
Is he able to share those figures with the House?
I understand, and indeed endorse, the precaution of NHS England in quarantining evacuees from Wuhan at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral.
I must mention my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral West (Margaret Greenwood), who is the local MP and who has been in touch regularly with Ministers, her constituents and the hospital since the news broke last Thursday.
I have been contacted by a patient in quarantine who has told me that evacuees are tested for the virus only if they display symptoms because risk of virus transmission is considered low.
It would help to reassure the House if the Secretary of State could clarify why, if risk of transmission among non-symptomatic evacuees is low, there is no option for evacuees to self-quarantine at home.
I understand that Japan and the Netherlands are allowing such quarantine.
but it would be helpful if he could offer greater clarity and those reassurances.
Indeed, what would be the response of the Government and the NHS if evacuees wanted to leave Arrowe Park and self-quarantine at home?
Could he update the House on that?
l As I say, I endorse the precautions that Ministers are taking,
I welcome the public information campaign.
Will the Secretary of State update us on what discussions he has had with local authority public health officials and local authorities’ social care providers and social care staff, who are obviously caring for people who are especially vulnerable to the respiratory problems associated with coronavirus?
This is a time of considerable strain on the NHS.
I know the Secretary of State and I disagree on why that is, but he will accept that it is a time of huge pressure.
How many specialist beds are available across the system to deal with more cases of coronavirus should we need them, and what is the capacity of trusts to flex up extra specialist beds if needed?
If we do succumb to the epidemic in the UK, that will start to affect the wider NHS workforce as well.
What plans are in place to ensure that NHS staff are protected over the coming months—because, as he rightly says, this is a marathon, not a sprint?
I am sure the Secretary of State would agree that we should have no truck with the racism and insensitivity shown towards Chinese and east Asian people that we have sadly seen in some quarters, with wrongly attributed videos showing wild animals being eaten and crass cartoons in the Evening Standard.
Indeed, the French media are digging up old racist tropes as well.
None of these attempts to dehumanise an entire ethnicity should be allowed to prevail.
I welcome the Secretary of State’s statement today and hope he will continue to keep the House updated in the coming days and weeks.

Secondly, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has issued an urgent request for medical masks, protective suits and safety goggles.
Is this something the Government will be looking to provide?
Finally, what assessment has he made of the conflicting advice on closing borders—some voices are saying that this could inadvertently lead to an increase in the number of affected persons—and how has that impacted on any advice that he and his departmental officials have chosen to give?

Our thoughts must be with all those diagnosed with novel coronavirus and those in quarantine, and I place on record again our thanks to NHS and Public Health England staff and all other staff involved in responding to the outbreak.
On the specific issue of the quarantine arrangements, I understand the approach the Government have taken, and the Secretary of State will recall that in response to last week’s statement I asked him what would happen should an evacuee wish to leave Arrowe Park.
In response he understandably reminded the House that evacuees had signed contracts that effectively offered passage back to the UK in return for compliance with the Government’s quarantine arrangements.
However, given that questions were raised around how practically enforceable those contracts were, and indeed wider questions about what was allowed under human rights legislation, I understand why the Secretary of State has invoked the regulations that he is entitled to do under the Public Health Acts.
He has our support.
Quarantine arrangements must be seen to be necessary, proportionate and in accordance with law, and enforcement of those quarantine arrangements, including with powers of restraint where necessary, must be fully transparent, and the rights and freedoms of the quarantined evacuees must be fully understood so as to ensure they are treated with dignity and respect.
We agree that a legislative framework for this is far preferable to the ad hoc contracts that were the original basis for the quarantines.
In order to maintain public confidence in these arrangements, that framework must be understood and scrutinised by Parliament.
With that in mind, on the instrument the Secretary of State laid before the House yesterday, at what point will the House get an opportunity to consider the regulations and will that be on the Floor of the House?
I appreciate that the Secretary of State is not one of the business managers—although there is going to be a Government reshuffle so who knows by the end of the week—but if he can give us some clarity at this point on that, we will appreciate it.
Turning to the UK response more generally, can the Secretary of State tell the House if he is asking clinical commissioning groups and trusts to make plans should this outbreak turn into a pandemic in the coming months?
What work is he doing to ensure that the local plans are robust, and can he guarantee they will be fully resourced?
What communications have directors of public health in local authorities received and how will they continue to be kept informed?
Is the Secretary of State confident that NHS 111 has sufficient capacity to deal with increased numbers of calls?
Will community health trusts, which I understand will be tasked with visiting suspected patients in their homes to carry our swab tests, be given extra resources to scale up capacity, or will they be expected to fund this extra work from their existing baselines?
With respect to the capital facility the Secretary of State has announced, I understand that hospitals are being given specialist pods to quarantine patients and access to this facility.
Can he tell us whether GPs have the necessary equipment and resources to cope with patients who may present with novel coronavirus?
Will they be able to apply for this capital facility?
I welcome the Secretary of State’s advice on travel arrangements, not least with school holidays coming up next week.
Many people will want clarification.
Can he assure us that Foreign Office advice is fully aligned with Public Health England advice, and tell us what monitoring arrangements are in place at airports for flights returning not just from China but other places across the world where there has been a coronavirus outbreak?
Finally, can the Secretary of State update the House on international efforts to share research and intelligence, as well as attempts to find a vaccine, and a timescale?
He will know that there is a World Health Organisation summit today, for example.
On behalf of the official Opposition, we again thank all our hardworking NHS staff, particularly those on the frontline, some of whom have been diagnosed with coronavirus.

I would, however, also support that they must be transparent and proportionate.
I also welcome that the four chief medical officers across the UK are working together on this issue.
The Government are advising symptomatic returnees from the high-risk countries, but should that not be all people returning from high-risk countries?
We simply do not know what the prodromal part of the incubation period is, nor how infectious someone actually is before they have any symptoms at all.
I have to say that I was surprised to see the bus drivers, who were driving those on their way to quarantine, sitting in the front seat in shirt sleeves besides someone in full hazmat gear.
That seemed to me to send out a rather strange message.
It is also advised that only those from Hubei province should self-isolate even if asymptomatic, but we see from the cases in France that this is spreading very quickly and we already have 40,000 cases across 28 countries.
Therefore, if anyone is flying and going through airports, there is the risk of spread, of simply being on an aeroplane with someone coming from China.
I welcome the funding for vaccine research and the expansion to 12 test centres across the four nations,
but what publicity campaign is planned to educate the public upfront not to go to their GP and not to go to accident and emergency, where they will actually spread it to someone else?
I understand that the information is there on the Scottish NHS inform system or 111, but if someone is not looking maybe we need to be proactive about the message.
Finally, the UK is no longer part of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
While we are able to take part in the early warning and reporting system during transition, we are no longer part of the decision making or central procurement of vaccines.
How much of that system is the UK still able to be part of at the moment during transition and in the long term?

The World Health Organisation has warned that countries are “simply not ready” for a pandemic.
There has now been significant spread of the virus across the European continent—in Italy in particular, but other cases have been identified in Austria, Croatia and Switzerland.
This is clearly now very serious.
Yesterday there did appear to be a little bit of a discrepancy, if I may say so, between the travel advice from the CMO and the Secretary of State.
Can the Secretary of State clarify for the House what exactly the travel advice is for those travelling or seeking to travel to northern Italy?
I think that would be welcome.
We welcome the Secretary of State’s plans for Heathrow.
Could he explain to the House why that facility is proposed only for Heathrow, and why similar facilities will not be in place at other major airports, particularly the bigger airports such as Manchester and so on.
The Secretary of State mentioned the situation in Tenerife.
We are all obviously very concerned about the situation there.
Could he offer a little more detail about what advice and support are being offered to British nationals at this hotel?
I note what the Secretary of State says about schools, and I entirely understand it, but we do have several schools in England and Northern Ireland shut completely at the moment for a deep clean, after students and teachers returned from skiing trips.
I understand that schools should check relevant websites and get local advice, but does the Secretary of State expect advice to be sent to schools from the Department for Education?
If schools have to start shutting, will the Government consider arrangements for alternative schooling provision for those affected?
Will the Secretary of State update the House on how many specialist and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation beds are available across the NHS?
We know that the NHS is under intense pressure at this time of year—indeed, today the BBC is running a story about people waiting on trolleys in hospital corridors and so on.
The Nuffield Trust has warned that there is “little in the tank” to cope with coronavirus, and Public Health England has announced that tests for the condition are being increased to include people displaying flu-like symptoms at 11 hospitals and 100 GP surgeries across the UK.
Will community trusts and clinical commissioning groups fund the extra work related to coronavirus from their existing baselines, and is the Secretary of State making representations to the Treasury for additional emergency NHS revenue resource in the coming weeks?
Will he update the House on how much has been drawn from the capital facility for hospitals to develop specialist pods to quarantine patients, which he announced in his previous statement?
I reiterate that the Opposition want to work constructively with the Government on this issue.

That is 10 times the number that we saw with SARS, which suggests it is a very infectious condition.
Will the UK Government liaise with international partners to ensure accurate reporting?
It is critical to map the spread of coronavirus, and there will be a danger that some countries under-report because they are afraid of economic impacts.
Has any consideration been given to using thermal detection technology at Heathrow, and for that to be spread across more sites?
We can no longer think that this only involves people who come from a few countries—people follow different routes, and almost everyone coming in would need to be screened.
As the Secretary of State said, there is only a small window of opportunity when it is possible to prevent or contain the initial spread of coronavirus.
As I have previously said, I am concerned about not self-isolating asymptomatic people, particularly when we are aware that the case that spread the condition to others in the UK involved someone who was not significantly symptomatic.
We do not know what the prodromal phase of coronavirus is, and people could be spreading the condition without our knowledge.
The advice must be clear.
Does the Secretary of State recognise the confusion there is that those returning from certain parts of north Italy must self-isolate, even if asymptomatic, but those coming from China do not need to self-isolate if asymptomatic?
That is causing confusion and we may end up behind the curve.
If containment is to work, we must be ahead of the curve.
Self-isolating does not count as illness, so will the Government send a clear message to employers, so that those who are advised to self-isolate will still be paid or receive sickness cover?
Otherwise, there will be people who feel that they must go to work, because they simply cannot afford to have no income for two weeks.
The Secretary of State suggested that he would not go to wider northern Italy, and the Chief Medical Officer suggested that people with health conditions should not go there.
Travel insurance kicks in only when the Foreign and Commonwealth Office gives clear guidance.
Will that guidance be changed to state that people should not be travelling to wider northern Italy, and other areas, so that people are not disadvantaged by not having travel insurance if they choose not to put themselves, and indeed all of us, at risk of the disease spreading?",1658

Friend the Member for Hampstead and Kilburn (Tulip Siddiq) for applying for it.
In the short time that I have, I want to make a heartfelt plea to the Government of Iran.
We all have long memories in this House, and if I was to mention certain Iranian place names, such as Manjil, Rudbar or Bam, they would conjure up images of people diligently digging through rubble, searching for surviving earthquake victims.
Among them were British firefighters, doctors and aid workers, supported by donations from the British people.
They were all desperate to do their bit and were moved by nothing but mercy and love for their Iranian brothers and sisters.
They never stopped to think about politics, sanctions or diplomacy; they just saw a humanitarian need and acted—acted on the common bonds of kindness and compassion that unite our two peoples.
When we address Tehran today, we can only ask it to do the same.
For once, do not see Nazanin as a political football.
Do not see Nazanin as a bargaining chip.
Instead, see Nazanin the way the rest of the world does, particularly facing this new and terrifying threat to her health.
See Nazanin as the loving mother desperate to get back to Gabriella.
See Nazanin as the devoted wife in need of Richard’s care.
See Nazanin as we saw those innocent people lying helpless in the rubble of a humanitarian crisis.
You today have it in your gift to save her.
Nazanin does not deserve this fresh suffering.
She deserves only to come home today.
I hope that the Minister will join me in that plea and make a solemn commitment that if Tehran acts with compassion and generosity today, we will not forget our obligations to act with fairness and justice in resolving the other issues of dispute between our two countries.",1896

I had a problem with my printer when I was trying to print the Secretary of State’s statement.
I thank him for advance sight of the statement, and, indeed, for advance sight of the action plan this morning.
Let me also record my thanks for the briefing that the Leader of the Opposition and I received yesterday from departmental officials, the chief medical officer and the Government Chief Scientific Adviser.
I believe that the chief medical officer will brief parliamentarians later today, and I think that that is a very welcome initiative.
The Government’s strategy to contain then delay, research and then mitigate has our endorsement,
, but may I ask the Secretary of State for some specific clarifications?
The first relates to containment and self-isolation.
The Prime Minister said today—as, indeed, the Secretary of State has said before—that workers who self-isolate are considered to be on sick leave.
Can the Secretary of State confirm that those who need to self-isolate will not need to visit a GP to obtain a sick note, given that the Government’s advice is not to visit a GP?
As he will know, 2 million workers on low pay or insecure contracts in the gig economy do not even qualify for statutory sick pay.
He will also know that those who are receiving benefits are often asked to physically attend appointments.
Can he guarantee that no financial sanction will be imposed if they are asked to self-isolate?
Does the Secretary of State accept that people should not be forced to make a choice between their health and avoiding financial hardship?
We are told that he is considering emergency legislation.
Will he introduce legislation to remove the barriers to self-isolation so that all workers can receive the sick pay that they deserve?
That is in the interests of public health.
If he introduces such legislation, we will help him to get it on to the statute book quickly.
He could do it this week or he could do it next week, and we will support him.
Let us give all workers the security that they deserve, so that they do not have to put their health ahead of their financial interests or vice versa.
More broadly on the NHS and social care, I want to look at the response of the NHS and the support that it will be given through the containment and mitigation phases.
We know that around 80% of critical care beds were occupied last week.
We know that the NHS is short of 100,000 staff, and we also know that staff working in the NHS, particularly those on the frontline such as GPs, need to be protected as well.
Even if we take at face value the Government’s insistence that they have provided the NHS with the resources to deliver the commitments of the long-term plan—we obviously disagree on this, but that is a debate for another time—we can surely all accept that covid-19 is going to lead to increased demand on trusts and the wider NHS.
Every trust that sends a sample for testing has to pay for it to be couriered.
Trusts are likely to take on more agency staff.
If retired staff are encouraged to return to practice, the wage bill will increase.
By the way, on retired staff, can the Secretary of State reassure us that protections and oversight will be in place, particularly around returning staff who, as we understand it, will not need to go through a revalidation process for their licence?
On social care, we know that many who are at risk from the virus are the elderly and those with chronic conditions.
Social care is responsible for and has a duty of care to many of the people who are most vulnerable to the outbreak.
What advice does the Secretary of State have for social care providers, and will extra resources be announced for social care services?
On the emergency powers that he has briefed about, will he sit down with us and other Opposition parties to discuss the contents of that legislation?
On the global efforts to contain the virus, we know that disease knows no borders.
We cannot build a wall or an iron curtain around these islands.
Why, then, are the Government apparently walking away from the EU early warning and response system, which plays such a vital role in pandemic preparations?
We have been led to believe that No. 10 has overruled the Secretary of State on this.
Also, to contain the virus internationally, countries with weaker health systems need to be supported as well, otherwise, we will not contain the virus.
Can the Secretary of State update us on what help he is offering to the World Health Organisation on that front?
This is a serious time.
Our constituents will be concerned, and many will be frightened.
We will raise our concerns responsibly, but we offer to work constructively with the Government, because the public health interest and the safety of our constituents must always come first.",5402

The plan lays out a reasonable worst case scenario, and it is clear about the three time phases.
Research is of course ongoing, but this will help to prepare the public for decisions that may have to be made down the line.
At the moment, containment is based on self-isolation of cases, contacts and those who have travelled to risk areas, but with the spread elsewhere in the world, it is becoming harder to define risk areas.
With regard to north Italy, the chief medical officer talked about those with underlying conditions perhaps interpreting the advice more stringently and not travelling, so will the Government either discuss with insurance companies or even consider legislation to make underlying conditions an acceptable reason to cancel a holiday, so that people can get their money back rather than putting themselves at risk?
I agree with the Secretary of State regarding asymptomatic workers and sick pay, but there are staff who have no sick pay in their contract, and some protection has to be given to them.
He referred to the seven-day period for self-certification, but isolation is for 14 days, and we do not want people turning up at their GP surgery halfway through that period.
Can that be looked at?
One issue that I have come across is an employer telling a member of staff returning from a holiday in Tenerife that they should not come to work for two weeks, but the employer does not wish to pay them for that period.
We need to look at that, even if it is not health advice but an employer stipulation expecting people to have no income.
As we move into delay, we see that children are not particularly vulnerable to catching this.
However, as with other coronaviruses, they may well spread it.
Do we have evidence for how much they contribute to transmission, as that will affect decisions on school closures?
What preparations are being made for the long haul?
Previous coronavirus outbreaks have lasted not just for a few months but for over a year, so we could be dealing with this next winter.
If we move into mitigation, the situation will reverse and it will be about protecting the vulnerable and early discharge to home care.
That might require the changing of staff from hospitals and care homes to work in the community, so are the Government in negotiations on such matters as legal responsibility and liability?
The Secretary of State quite rightly talked about what the public should be doing, but should we not already be thinking about stopping shaking hands and about working from home, if possible, without an economic impact?
That would also help the climate emergency.
Containment moves into delay without a border, so should we not be thinking about trying to get ahead of the curve?",1776

Let me also record, again, our thanks and gratitude to our hard-working NHS and Public Health England staff.
May I press the Secretary of State a little further?
He will know that we have called repeatedly for an emergency funding package for our NHS, he will know that the NHS is short of 100,000 staff, and he will know that critical care beds were at 81% capacity during the week for which the latest figures are available.
The Chancellor has said that the NHS will receive whatever it needs.
Does the Secretary of State agree that in this Wednesday’s Budget we need to see significantly more resources for the NHS, not just rhetoric?
Scaling up and freeing up capacity in the NHS is now urgent.
What is being done to scale up intensive care beds in the NHS, what is being done to expand access to the oxygen and ventilation machines that will be needed, and what is the current capacity of extra corporeal membrane oxygenation beds?
We welcome the distribution of personal protective equipment to NHS staff, but does the Secretary of State agree that GPs and social care staff also need access to that equipment?
Those in receipt of social care are some of the most vulnerable, and could be affected extremely badly by this virus.
Indeed, many who work in social care are low paid, and if they have to go on sick leave there are huge implications for the delivery of social care.
What advice has been given to social care providers and, indeed, local authorities to ensure that the most vulnerable are protected, and what plans are in place to protect staff and increase the number in the social care sector?
Public health directors are expected to play a leading role in local preparations.
They need to make decisions about deploying staff—Public Health England, for example, has asked for staff to be seconded—yet they still do not know their public health allocations for the next financial year, which will start in three weeks’ time.
We are begging the Secretary of State: please tell local directors of public health what their Budget is for this coming April.
We are still officially in the containment stage.
At some point, we presume, we will need to move into the delay stage, when we understand that social distancing measures will be necessary.
Many of our constituents are now asking—and I think it would benefit the House if the Secretary of State could explain to them—why we are not yet considering more home working, whether we should be asking those over 65 to isolate themselves, whether we should be cancelling larger events, and whether those returning from northern Italy, for instance, should be quarantined.
I think it would help our constituents if the Secretary of State ran through the medical advice, although I understand why he has made the decisions that he has made.
Can the Secretary of State also confirm that once we move into the phase in which measures of this magnitude are proposed, he will come to the House, explain why that has happened, and allow Members to question him?
He has hinted, or suggested, that we will need emergency legislation for the mitigation stage.
As a responsible Opposition, we would like to sit down with him in order to understand the content of that legislation, because we want to work on a cross-party basis; but let me leave him in no doubt that we also want statutory sick pay for all from day one.
Asking people to wait five weeks for universal credit is not a serious solution.
Will the Secretary of State update the House on food supplies and the conversations that he has had with supermarkets?
Can he reassure us that our constituents do not need to be panic-buying, as we saw people doing on social media in some parts of the country over the weekend?
Finally, does he agree that whatever happens, we must find a way for Parliament to continue to hold Ministers to account so that we can ask questions on behalf of our constituents?

I thank you, Mr Speaker, for your constructive engagement with the Opposition on these matters.
I know that you will continue that, and we welcome it.
I put on the record my sorrow that two more people have died, and I express our deepest condolences to their loved ones and family.
Again, we thank the NHS and Public Health England staff for all they are doing.
Will the Secretary of State convey our very best wishes to the Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, the hon. Member for Mid Bedfordshire (Ms Dorries), who is in all our thoughts, as well as to her staff in both her departmental private office and her parliamentary office?
I am sure they are all very worried, and I want them to know that they are in our thoughts as well at this time.
We welcome what the Secretary of State has said about Parliament and his advice to keep Parliament open.
It is crucial that Members should be able to continue to raise issues on behalf of their constituents and hold Ministers to account.
I note that he said that procedures or arrangements may need to be modified, and we look forward to continued engagement on that front.
I also welcome the advice that the right hon. Gentleman has given to people who have come into contact with the hon. Member for Mid Bedfordshire, but can he offer us some extra advice?
I have heard about cases of this today.
What is the advice for those who work on the estate who feel ill and appear to have symptoms but have not, as far as they are aware, been in contact with the hon. Lady?
Should they now be tested as well as a matter of routine?
The advice for them is just to self-isolate, but what is the latest guidance on that front?
We welcome the opportunity to discuss emergency legislation.
The Secretary of State knows that we have concerns about statutory sick pay and other issues, but we will engage constructively on that front and seek to pass emergency legislation in a timely manner.
He also knows that we support the action of the chief medical officer and we very strongly agree that we must at all times be guided by the science.
However, may I press him a little further on the epidemiology, the latest medical advice and the appropriate moment when we should move into the so-called delay stage and start adopting some of the more stringent social distancing strategies?
The right hon. Gentleman will have seen that some in the science community—the editor-in-chief of The Lancet, for example—are suggesting that we are not following the epidemiology in the correct way and that we are perhaps placing too much emphasis on behavioural science.
Other countries are taking different approaches.
Tonight, for example, 3,000 Atlético Madrid fans are arriving in Liverpool to watch the champions league game.
If that game was in Madrid, they would not be able to go to the stadium because of the Spanish social distancing measures.
Will the Secretary of State explain the thinking in the United Kingdom and why it appears to differ from that of some of the other nations in Europe?
Our constituents would welcome that.
I have just a couple of final points, Mr Speaker.
On the Budget, it would be churlish of me not to recognise that extra funding was announced for the NHS and social care as part of the covid-19 response.
It is something that we have long been calling for.
Will the Secretary of State tell us how that money will be allocated, and what happens when that money is depleted?
The NHS has said today that it is seeking to scale up intensive care beds sevenfold.
That fund will run out at some point and it will need topping up.
Do we have to wait for the spending review process in the summer, or will it be topped up over the coming weeks and months?
I am sorry to ask the Secretary of State this again, but when will we get the public health allocations?
I would have thought that we would have had them today.
Please, let us know when we are getting them.
We must do all we can to support NHS staff at this time.
The NHS has suggested suspending Care Quality Commission inspections for now.
What is his view on that?
As he says, this is now designated a pandemic by the World Health Organisation.
We agree that we all have to do our bit.
The Government have our continued co-operation, because public health and public safety must always come first.",3999

I welcome the declaration to keep Parliament open, but surely we should be looking at core functions, at who comes into the House and at what we do in the House.
I have to say that I was a bit disappointed to have several hundred of us jammed into the voting Lobbies on Tuesday.
That is just not a good idea.
There are ways of working that would still allow Parliament to stay open.
With cases having increased by 13 times outside China in just two weeks, the virus has of course been declared a pandemic by the WHO, which describes its concerned at “levels of inaction”.
It calls for quicker and wider testing so that milder cases are diagnosed quickly, isolated and the spread reduced.
We have seen the speed of change in northern Italy over a matter of a couple of weeks, so should we not be thinking about the delay phase?
Containment and delay are a continuum; it is not a switch between one and the other.
We see large leisure events still continuing.
They are not critical, so should we not be decreasing them?
Do we know yet whether children are spreaders?
We know they do not catch the virus, but do they spread it?
That would be central to any decision about closing schools, and obviously closing schools would have an impact on NHS and social care staff.
I welcome the announcement in the Budget of funding to support people on sick pay, but will the Secretary of State clarify whether this will be provided to people who do not have sick pay in their contract?
That is exactly who we were concerned about when we raised this point.
How quickly will all three devolved Governments hear about the extra funding that they are going to get, since it is urgent for them to take action as well?
There has been talk about bringing doctors back from retirement.
Is there a discussion with the General Medical Council about relicensing doctors, and about providing Crown indemnity for doctors who may have retired within the last year or two?
The UK is already outside the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, so will the Government now at least rethink leaving the pandemic early warning and response system?",1499

What a U-turn from the situation not that long ago, when we had to take them to court to keep it open.
Does the Secretary of State accept that it does not have to be all or nothing?
A lot of things happen in this place that are not essential to the functioning of our democracy and that, either in fact or certainly in perception, create a high risk of infection.
For example, why do we still have functions at which food is left out on uncovered plates on a table at the end of the room without enough sets of tongs, meaning people have little choice but to help themselves using their hands?
Why is it that, on the few occasions that we have to divide the House, we cannot use a deferred Division system so that people go through the Lobbies in dribs and drabs over a two or three-hour period, instead of being crammed in, 300 at a time, within a maximum time limit of eight minutes?
Will the Secretary of State and his colleagues in government look at some of the practices in this place, partly to minimise the chances of our carrying this infection back to our constituencies but also to send a message to the rest of the population that we have identified where our own practices fall short of the best standards of hygiene and that we are taking steps to correct it?",732

Our thoughts must be with the loved ones of those who have sadly died from the virus, including the family of the man who died at the Leicester Royal Infirmary in my constituency over the weekend.
I pay tribute to all our NHS staff, our social care staff and, indeed, all who work in public services.
Never have we been more in their debt, and will be in the coming weeks.
The public, as indeed all Members of the House, want the national effort to succeed.
Every one of our constituents wants to do the right thing for their loved ones, for their neighbours and for themselves.
The virus spreads rapidly.
It exploits ambivalence.
It demands clarity of purpose.
It demands Government effort as we have never seen before in peacetime.
With that in mind, I put a number of questions to the Secretary of State, which I trust he accepts are raised in a constructive spirit.
Specifically, on today’s measures, which we endorse, if we are asking people to work from home if they can, what is the advice to those who are not able to work from home because of their occupation—millions who work in the retail sector, for example?
Today, the Government will ask the elderly and those with long-term conditions to shield themselves, starting at the weekend.
Can the Secretary of State give us more details of how that will work in practice?
Will they be able to exercise or go for a walk?
What happens if someone refuses to follow the advice?
How will those who need social care support get the care they need?
What protections are in place for social care staff embarking on regular 15-minute visits?
How will those with complex needs and disabilities be supported?
We know that those with co-morbidities and a compromised immune system are also vulnerable.
What specific advice is there for those with conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and cardiovascular issues, who the emerging literature shows to be particularly vulnerable at the moment?
How will those people access repeat prescriptions?
I understand the gravity of the situation.
Could the Secretary of State update the House on how far away from the peak he thinks we are?
While I understand the reasoning for the decisions the Government have made today, surely there will now come a moment when schools will close.
Teachers are already anxious, and parents need to plan.
Can he offer some advice to parents, who will be worried tonight?
Throughout the outbreak, we have been as one in agreeing that all decisions must be based on science and evidence, but the Secretary of State, of course, will know and understand that different scientists can reach different conclusions, even when presented with the same data and evidence, so does he agree that all the evidence informing the UK’s strategy must be transparent, and that the modelling and the evidence base should be published, so that it can be peer-reviewed and stress-tested?
This is about maintaining public confidence.
May I press the Secretary of State on the controversy, if I may put it like that, of recent days, in the debate about so-called herd immunity?
He said yesterday that herd immunity is not the goal.
The chief scientific adviser suggested something slightly different on Thursday.
Could the Secretary of State clarify the Government’s position?
May I put a point that is repeatedly raised by our constituents?
I hope that the Secretary of State appreciates the way in which we are putting these points to him.
Many of our constituents are asking us why the UK has hitherto seemed to have taken a different course from other nations.
They have suggested that other nations have been deliberately trying to delay, and to buy time to prepare for, future outbreaks.
Will he explain what ideas the Government have and have not rejected, and what lessons they have learned, from countries such as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, which have brought the virus under relative control through containment policies?
What lessons can we learn from Germany and Scandinavia, which, in recent days, according to the data, are reporting death rates of less than three per 1,000 covid-19 cases, whereas in the UK and France, the figure is much higher?
May I press the Secretary of State on the advice of the World Health Organisation?
It has been clear that testing and contact tracing should continue.
Many of our constituents are saying to us that surely we need community testing to continue, because we need to know the percentage of the population infected at any one time.
Otherwise, the percentage of immunity will be unknown.
People who are ill, those who work in the NHS or the care sector, and anyone caring for elderly relatives will surely want to know their covid-19 status, because it will have an impact on how they interact with other people in the community.
NHS staff are being asked to care for covid-19 patients, not knowing whether they themselves are transmitting the virus.
If they get ill, will they now be asked to stay at home for 14 days?
Surely if we can test those NHS staff, and the test returns negative, we can get them back on the frontline sooner.
Is the issue around testing about capacity?
If it is, has the Secretary of State considered demanding that UK-based pharmaceutical companies hand us their labs?
Can we use the testing labs in higher education institutions and universities?
Can diagnostic kit makers be urged to manufacture more testing kit urgently?
On a vaccine, we understand the timescales involved, but can the Secretary of State confirm that he will approve funding for scaling up manufacturing of the vaccine candidates that are being developed in the UK?
On antivirals, clinical trials on repurposing drugs are under way across the globe; can he provide a written statement to the House on what capacity the UK has to assist in that process?
Turning quickly to the capacity of the national health service, our NHS and social care staff need support.
They need quality personal protective equipment, whether in secondary care or primary care.
Can the Secretary of State tell us how many additional intensive care unit beds have been opened?
I think he has hinted that non-emergency elective treatment will now be suspended; could he confirm that?
Members have long been asking him about ventilators.
Can he outline the latest numbers, and say where he thinks we will be by this time next week?
Can he update us on ECMO bed capacity, and say whether he is also increasing the availability of non-invasive ventilation, such as BPAP?
If we need beds and equipment from private sector organisations, we should requisition that equipment, not pay for it.
Finally, we will co-operate with the Government on the proposed emergency legislation, and I am grateful for the discussions we have had, but the biggest challenge to the public health social distancing measures will not be boredom and fatigue; it will be finances and affordability.
The poorest, who struggle to pay the rent, those who worry about putting food on the table, and those who have no savings to dip into, will be faced with impossible choices between hardship and health.
From sick pay and lost earnings protection, to universal credit changes and rent and mortgage payment deferrals, we need a package of financial support, and we look forward to working with the Secretary of State on that front.
These are indeed serious times.
Many of our constituents are anxious, and want as much certainty as possible.
We have put these questions to the Secretary of State because the health and safety of the nation must always come first.",6706

The briefing from the Prime Minister talked about not providing emergency services for large gatherings, but can the Secretary of State clarify whether the Government are advising against or forbidding mass gatherings?
I welcome the talk about increasing testing capability, but the briefing talked about only testing those in hospital and key workers.
In Scotland, surveillance testing in practices that monitor disease in the community is continuing.
Will that also be the case here in England?
Following the confusion over the weekend and, indeed, the comments that he has just made about healthy people over 70, will the Secretary of State clarify what exactly is the advice for people over 70 who live in their own homes or in care homes?
Are they meant to be staying at home, or are they simply meant to be decreasing contact?
In particular, is the Secretary of State discussing with social care providers lengthening the time of each visit so that there is time for the careworker to take precautions?
He says that the healthy should go to work, but what if they work in a club?
What provision is being made for socially vulnerable people such as the homeless or those who have no recourse to public funds, such as refugees or asylum seekers?

We hear what he says on freight, but could he give us any guidance on what is “essential travel” when it comes to people?
Does it include people coming home?
This is a time of immense concern for tens of thousands of British nationals stranded abroad; they are not just dealing with the stress of trying to get accurate information and make their way home, but doing so facing the ever-present fear of infection.
I was contacted yesterday by Tom, one of the 65 British nationals in Cusco, Peru, which has announced a 15-day state of emergency, with its borders closed and the army enforcing a quarantine.
Tom’s flight to Britain today has been cancelled and his calls to our embassy in Lima have not been answered.
Why is that?
Because the embassy itself has decided to close down for 15 days, just when its services were needed most.
The Secretary of State said in his statement that our “consular teams are working around the clock to provide the best…information available to UK nationals”;well, I am afraid that that simply is not the case in Tom’s experience.
He says:“We have received no advice or assistance…we are all extremely concerned at being stranded here.
”Across the world, there are tens of thousands of British nationals in the same position as Thomas, and all have the same message for the British Government: “Help bring us home”.
As far as they are concerned, their travel is essential and it is no use telling them to rely on advice from the Governments in the countries from which they are travelling when, inevitably, they will be the least of those countries’ concerns.
Nor is it any use telling them to rely on the instructions of their travel operators, which, all too often in recent weeks, have been at odds with the official FCO travel advice and are driven by the fear of insurance claims and bankruptcy, not by the needs of our citizens.
The Government cannot keep passing the buck to others, especially when it comes to repatriation.
Yes, it is difficult, and yes, it is expensive, but that is the nature of the crisis that we face.
In his response, can the Secretary of State directly address Tom and his compatriots in Peru and all the other British nationals around the world currently in the same position, and tell them what he is doing to help bring them home?
Will the Secretary of State reassure us today that the Foreign Office will learn the lessons from this fiasco by asking itself some very basic questions?
First, why were there no clear protocols in place for evacuation and repatriation in the event of an outbreak such as this?
If those protocols were in place, why were they not followed?
Secondly, why has official travel advice from the FCO been so slow to match what is happening on the ground?
This weekend, we had tour operators going door to door in French ski resorts, telling British families to leave immediately, while the Foreign Office website said that there were no restrictions on travel.
Thirdly and most basically, as Tom’s case in Peru illustrates, will the Foreign Secretary determine why the levels of consular support have been so out of step with the levels of global demand?
When the dust settles on this crisis, as we all hope it eventually will, we will reflect on what has been a chronic failure of global leadership and co-ordination in which our own Government has sadly been a part.
Instead of every country working together to agree best practice and apply common standards on testing, tracking, travel restrictions, quarantines, self-isolation and social distancing, we have instead seen a global free- for-all, with every country going it alone.
Instead of the international community coming together to pool its experience and work together to develop a vaccine and a cure, we have again seen individual companies and countries working in silos.
We have also seen a shameful attempt by Donald Trump to buy the German company that is in the lead when it comes to discovering a vaccine, not just to steal the glory of the vaccine for himself, but to hoard it for the Americans alone.
The challenges posed by the coronavirus are fearful enough for the world without our leaders compounding them through their incompetence or their inaction.
That is exactly what we have seen when it comes to this Government’s approach to repatriation, but it is part of a pattern that goes far beyond that one issue and far beyond our one country.
Will the Secretary of State undertake today that, as well as fixing the immediate issues that we face with the coronavirus, not least around repatriations, Britain will lead the way in ensuring that these outbreaks will be better managed in future?",6470

His statement did not deal with the point about insurance at all.
For Scots and Brits abroad who are stuck and want to get back, and are looking to find a way to do so, the biggest practical help that we can offer right now is to speak to insurance companies, because their insurance is uppermost in their mind.
Colleagues will be aware of the statement this morning from Sir Charles Bean of the Office for Budget Responsibility:“You need the state to be there as the insurer of last resort against what is effectively an act of God.
The state surely has a role.
Big early action is surely better than half-hearted action that is late.
”We could not agree more.
The Chancellor is making a statement later, but insurance is the biggest priority for our nationals who are overseas and want to get back.
I urge the Secretary of State to have a full discussion with the Chancellor on that point.

For over a month we have known about the substantial risk that coronavirus poses to the economy and to workers, yet the Government have announced no plan to protect jobs and wages—no full plan for employment support.
We are all—all of us—inundated with so many questions, and I have just four of those questions to ask.
People are asking us:,why, for example, have Denmark, which had its first coronavirus case on 27 February, and New Zealand, which had its first case on 28 February, four weeks after our first case, both announced comprehensive job protection plans, while we have announced nothing to secure people’s jobs and wages?
Given that, the second question is: what consideration has been given to the models in Denmark and Austria, which the Economic Secretary referred to, which involve the Government paying the bulk of people’s wages in exchange for job guarantees?
The third question is: why, when the Chancellor announced the loan guarantee on Tuesday, did the Government not tie those loans into an undertaking from business that no one would be laid off?
The fourth question: will the Minister accept that freelancers will need additional support if they do not qualify for statutory sick pay?
For example, in the culture sector we have as many as 2 million people, hundreds of thousands of whom may be affected.
The country deserves answers to those questions as a matter of urgency.

In Scotland, that support has been passed on in full by our Finance Secretary, Kate Forbes.
However, I remain concerned that not enough support is being mobilised for sole traders, freelancers and the self-employed.
Today though, our focus is rightly on people, many of whom are already self-isolating or moving to work from home, if indeed they can.
But bills are still coming in and rent payments are being sought, and so I welcome the news that some support will be put in place, for example, for payment for energy bills.
The question is who is eligible for that, and will that go far enough.
Will the Government use the tax system to put thousands of pounds in people’s pockets by way of an emergency universal basic income?
Will the Government extend statutory sick pay to the 2 million people who earn less than £118 a week and benchmark it to at least the real living wage?
Firms are already starting to make staff redundant, but we need to stem the flow of that immediately, and today.
The Government should introduce a statutory retention scheme to provide firms with financial support to keep staff in employment during this uncertain time.
Now more than ever, our social security system needs to kick in.
To protect families impacted by hardship and strengthen automatic stabilisers that support demands in the economy, does the Minister agree that the main adult rate of out of work support in universal credit and other benefits, including carer’s allowance, should rise by a third to £100 per week?
We are in the midst of a national emergency the likes of which I have never seen before.

2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a121.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25279,Nick Thomas-Symonds,Labour,"Shadow Minister (Home Office) (Security), Shadow Solicitor General",0,"I rise to speak, ostensibly, to amendments 2 to 4 and new clause 4, in my name and in the names of my hon. and right hon. Friends.
This is certainly no criticism of the Public Bill Office, which has worked extraordinarily well under huge pressure, nor of Ministers or, indeed, of officials working under tremendous pressure, but in the past hour and a half, as the Opposition spokesperson, I have been presented with 60 pages covering 61 Government amendments, and there are also 27 Opposition amendments.
It is clear that I will not be able to cover every single item in my remarks, but I will try to refer—[Interruption.]
Not this early in the evening, but who knows?
I will try to cover the amendments thematically, referring to them when it would be helpful to the House.
Amendments 2 to 4 relate to the Bill’s emergency powers, which I will deal with first because the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis) mentioned them and I want to make our position absolutely clear.
New clause 4 would place a duty on the Government to support the basic means of living—food, water, clothing, income and housing—by employing all available statutory and prerogative powers.
Those two themes may be separate on the amendment paper, but they go hand in hand.
The public health emergency and the restrictions on freedom must be accompanied by the strongest possible financial measures to ensure people still have the means to get by.
I make it clear that I do not intend to divide the House on any of these amendments this evening, but I hope the Government will listen to my points.
The second world war emergency legislation required renewal every year, and the emergency coronavirus legislation in Ireland is subject to six-monthly renewal.
We need safeguards.
Often, the issue with this type of legislation, which is understandably done in haste, is not so much the intended consequences as the unintended consequences.
That is important because there are vulnerable people across our society whose lives are going to change and who will need protection.
The Bill is subject to the European convention on human rights and does not exclude judicial review; there is no ouster clause in it.
These are very important safeguards, and we need more.
I welcome the Government’s concession on six-monthly review.
I have listened carefully to a number of speeches, and I, like many others, would like it to have been even more frequent, but I accept that that is a reasonable compromise.
There are some issues on which I would like reassurance from the Minister, though.
First, it is clear that that is subject to a vote in both Houses, but the point made by the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden is crucial: if it is simply an unamendable motion, the House is left with the choice of take it or leave it on everything.
It could be that we think four fifths of the Bill is achieving its intended purpose and one fifth is not, but we would have to keep everything operational.
If the Minister can confirm that the motion will be amendable, so we can make clear which bits we want to switch off, that would make a significant difference.
Even if she gave that as a verbal assurance, it would be a step forward that might increase the degree of consensus across the House.
I am not saying that everyone would be satisfied, but it would help us to move forward on the basis of consensus.
As I read the Government amendment, there is a carve-out in relation to devolved matters.
Will the Minister make the position clear?
If this House switched off powers, would they be automatically switched off for the devolved institutions; or if a power was switched on by the devolved institutions, would they then have the power to switch it off when they saw fit?
In those parts of England without formal regional devolution, would it be it switched off automatically for those areas?
More widely, we have to ensure that the measures are temporary and that hard-won rights are not lost forever.
In that respect, I want to focus on a number of groups in our society.
First, amendments 68 to 71 deal with children with special educational needs and disabilities.
I would like more reassurance from the Government.
The Bill clearly removes disabled people’s rights to social care and support, and the duty to meet children’s educational requirements is changed to a reasonable endeavours duty.
Many hon. and right hon. Members will have received expressions of concern about that.
I thank the all-party group on this for raising it over the weekend.
Of course there is a need for flexibility.
There will be a need to redeploy staff, and we all understand that, but reassurance is necessary.
If we are removing the rights in the Children and Families Act 2014, for example, could consideration be given to the proposal in the amendments to change “reasonable endeavours” to “all practical steps” to ensure that our duty to some of our most vulnerable and youngest people is met?
There is also deep concern in the care sector, to which amendments 57 to 63 and new clause 29 apply.
Most statutory duties relating to social care are being suspended under schedule 11.
Local authorities will only have to provide services deemed necessary to prevent breaches of people’s human rights.
That is clearly not the vision of social care that anyone in this House had in mind when the Care Act 2014 was passed.
Of course, the Bill does not prevent local authorities from providing higher levels of care, but there is no longer any duty to carry out assessments or involve user input in care delivery, and local authorities will no longer have to assess the needs of carers.
Those are sweeping changes that may reduce the level of support.
Will the Government make it clear that they still expect care to be provided to the highest level possible in the circumstances, and that some sort of green light to cut back to the minimum is not provided for in the Bill?
There are wider impacts.
There are doctors, nurses, NHS staff and key workers who rely on social care for their family members.
That new legal minimum level of support cannot become a default.
We cannot have care packages automatically cut back to the minimum, and care levels should never be reduced too far or too fast.
I have referred to a series of amendments, and I would push the Government on this.
Can we look at things such as reasonable practicability?
Can we look at disrupting existing care in the most minimal way and try at least to ensure, while recognising the pressures on staff, that reductions in care packages are a last resort?
There are many unmet care needs, and people are being looked after in their own home by family members, who visit every day.
For a start, that unpaid army of carers deserves deep gratitude from all of us, but what if one of those unpaid carers needs to self-isolate?
What will the Government look at to protect people in their own home who will still be in need of care?
The Government have to make absolutely clear the value of the measures for those who are older, and for disabled and young people who are in need of support.
Many people—not just my constituents but people across the country—including disabled rights groups and, indeed, disabled people have contacted me to say that they are very, very concerned about what they regard as the scaling back of their rights under the Bill.
We must protect them as best we can for the duration of the emergency powers, but also make it clear that this temporary hiatus does not represent a rolling back of progress over decades.
Turning to mental health and amendments 64 and 65, there are changes in the Bill to the detention regime and a restriction whereby someone can be detained on the say-so of a single doctor, which is a significant change for committal.
That is set out in schedule 7.
In the first instance, can that be the case only where it is absolutely necessary?
Secondly, can we have no single recommendation from a doctor at a private hospital when the patient is detained at that hospital?
Can we at least seek to adhere to timetables that are already in place?
There are powers in the Bill on extension and removal of time limits, which clearly no Parliament in ordinary circumstances would wish to introduce.
Can the Minister at least give some sort of guarantee that timetables will be respected as far as possible?",9422

He makes a useful suggestion, which is why I also suggest that a single doctor should sign only when absolutely necessary.
Even in that case, the point that my right hon. Friend makes is useful.
I am sure that the Government understand concern about the proposals, and I hope that the Minister will be able to provide us with reassurance.
Turning to the issue of law and order, I would be grateful if the Minister passed on my gratitude to the Security Minister, who has spoken to me mostly from home, where he is self-isolating, on a number of provisions in clauses 21 and 22 on the appointment of temporary judicial commissioners, changes to urgent warrants under investigative powers, and an additional measure on data retention.
I understand that the biometrics commissioner supports that measure, but I hope that he can comment on and deal with those provisions in the next few days.
I also understand that action will be taken to ensure that the temporary judicial commissioners receive the appropriate training, but clearly that will have to be done on a remote basis.
It is important that we maintain existing standards as far as possible.
I know that the measure on data retention is an emergency power—of course, we do not want data on people who may wish to do us harm simply to disappear because somebody was not available to carry out the national security determination—but we must say, as the right hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell) did in relation to the last point, that this can only be a temporary measure.
We must return to the existing deadlines as soon as we can.
Courts and tribunals are covered in clauses 51 to 55.
Clearly we must look to live links and audio technology, but we must try to secure justice in each and every case.
We cannot allow any court user to be in danger of being transmitted the coronavirus.
The Lord Chief Justice has said today that there will be no new jury trials, but clearly some jury trials—including some very long-term ones—are still ongoing.
Every step must be taken to ensure that social distancing is imposed by the judges in those courts.
Although all Members agree on following advice about self-isolation, in cases of domestic violence self-isolation can create a situation that is favourable to abusers.

If this emergency lasts—which I am afraid it is going to—and people are put in situations where they are close to their abusers, we must still have some sort of safeguards in place, particularly in our courts system.
Our prisons cannot become laboratories for transmission, and neither can our immigration detention centres—a point that I hope the Paymaster General will pass on to the Home Secretary.
The issue of burial has clearly caused great controversy.
I know that the Paymaster General is one of the people who have come up with the final version on this matter, and I thank her for the efforts that she has made.
This issue is clearly vital for Muslims and those of the Jewish faith.
Clearly, they need to be in a position where we respect their rights about burial as far as we possibly can.

On restricting freedoms—and there are, quite frankly, draconian restrictions of freedom in this Bill including in relation to mass gatherings, the closure of ports and borders, and detention powers over potentially infectious people, which I read as applying to children and adults—the Government must do only what is necessary and proportionate.

This must be a rare example of a shadow Minister having called for something at the start of a debate and its having appeared before we have finished the debate.
The Prime Minister is responsive on that if nothing else.
Even in this situation, proportionality and necessity still apply.
It is clear that powers to detain potentially infectious people, including children in isolation facilities, will have to be implemented in a sensitive way.
It is necessary to postpone elections, as set out in clause 57, but we still have to do all we can to maintain our democracy.
I welcomed the Speaker’s statement setting out any moves we can make to vote in a different way and to operate in a far more digital and remote way than has been the case in the past.
Let me turn to new clause 4 and the issues it raises.
Quite simply, if we are to ask people to sacrifice their freedom by staying at home and subjecting themselves to the measures set out by the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr Baker), their basic means of living must be catered for as well.
There are some specific measures in the Bill, but I commend to the Minister amendments 74 to 78, on lowering the threshold for eligibility for statutory sick pay, and new clauses 32 to 34, on the extension of statutory sick pay to the self-employed and its uprating.
Before I move on to some of the other economic measures, particularly in the Government’s new amendment, let me refer to new clause 35.
A number of right hon. and hon. Members from all parties have raised the issue of access to personal protective equipment.
New clause 35 sets out the importance of that to the Opposition by defining it as part of the Minister’s role to make sure that that equipment is provided to everybody who needs it.
That is the imperative that the Opposition put on that, and I hope the Government will do all they can to ensure that not one person in this country does not have the personal protective equipment that they need to keep us all safe.",1165

As one person put it to me, the applause and support for healthcare workers is all very well, but they also want to know that their health and wellbeing is considered to be just as important as everybody else’s, if not more so.",312

Government new clause 16 increases the top threshold for the level of assistance that can be given to industry for the purpose of the economic crisis, and I welcome the proposed change.
The Government must do what they can to prevent an economic disaster.
However, I would also ask that the Government structure financial assistance to ensure that the Government bail-out supports the workforce, the sustainability of the company and the wider national interest.
Perhaps the Minister can confirm, now or subsequently, that the Government will attach restrictions in areas such as staff retention, dividend buy-outs, share buy-backs and executive remuneration for any company receiving financial assistance, and whether the Government will seek equity stakes in those companies that receive significant assistance.
There is also the issue of renters, in respect of which the Government have tabled a new clause, and there is real concern about this.
It was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon Central (Sarah Jones) on Second Reading.
There is a concern about the Prime Minister and his promises to the country’s 20 million renters to protect them from evictions, because this does not seem to be an evictions ban, which is what the Opposition have argued for, and we understood was promised by the Prime Minister.
The legislation does not seem to stop people losing their home as a result of coronavirus; it would just give them some extra time to pack their bags.
In a sense, that makes us wonder why the Government are not willing to make a very simple change.
I understand that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey) wrote to Ministers to give them the legislation that would provide the protections, banning evictions and suspending rental payments beyond the crisis.
There is already welcome help for homeowners, and I hope the Government will look again at their promises to renters.
We do not need this public health emergency to become a crisis of housing and homelessness as well.
As the Government disturb people’s way of life, they must also sustain everyday existence, and people are anxious about sustaining themselves through this difficult time.

I have already set out that statutory sick pay is too low at £94.25 a week.

We must also speak of the businesses laying off workers and not applying for the 80% coverage of wages, which is what they should be doing.
There are people who have lost their jobs, and who need help fast.
It is a concern that the 80% wages support applies in the April payroll, not the March payroll, and what that will mean is that money will not be available until the end of next month.
I appreciate the scale of this and I appreciate that Treasury officials have done a lot of work on it, but as the days pass more and more people are losing their jobs.

May I start by thanking the Clerks and other staff for their extraordinary work in processing so many amendments in such a short time?
The changes that we propose are designed to ensure that the Government’s response is truly for all of society, as the World Health Organisation has urged, and we will do that by seeking to ensure that nobody is excluded from getting the support they need simply by virtue of their immigration status.
Our immigration and asylum laws and processes, touching as they do on millions of people right across our country, must be made to help, not hinder, the public health response to coronavirus.
If we let down those people who are subject to immigration control, we are letting down the whole country, and if we fail to protect those people, we fail to protect the population as a whole.
The new schedule is in four parts.
The first relates to Home Office rules that prevent many people from accessing public funds.
Many of this group will already be hugely marginalised, including a very significant proportion of the street homeless and destitute.
As matters stand, many more will become destitute because their earnings will stop or sofa-surfing will no longer be possible, and there will be no social security to fall back on.
Meanwhile, across the country many shelters providing the only source of refuge are having to close down, either because dormitory conditions are no longer fit for purpose, or because the brilliant volunteers who staff such centres can no longer undertake the necessary work amid this very serious crisis.
Suspending the no recourse to public funds rules would be a first but significant step towards allowing everyone to access the financial support and accommodation they need to protect themselves.
The second part of the schedule deals with those who are in immigration detention.
At the end of last year, there were about 1,600 people in immigration detention, most of them in immigration detention centres, with a small number in prisons.
We know from recently published expert advice that detention centres provide ideal conditions for the spread of the coronavirus, and that 60% of those in such facilities could rapidly be infected if the virus got hold there.
In fact, one woman tested positive for covid-19 in Yarl’s Wood at the weekend.
Of course, the detainee population will include a significant number with underlying health conditions.
We know now that there is no realistic prospect of immigration removals taking place imminently, and imminent removal is of course the legal threshold for justifying detention in the first place.
The clear consequences of these two facts, when we bring them together, is that continued detention is not only morally wrong, but it undermines the public health response to the coronavirus outbreak and is almost certainly illegal.
We welcome the fact that the Home Office has started by releasing about 300 of the current estimate of 1,200 people in immigration detention.
We ask it to move faster and urgently in getting the other 900 out of there as well.
Thirdly, we turn to the issue of the asylum process.
Those working on behalf of asylum seekers are concerned at the lack of communication with them about what changes are being made to these processes.
There was a welcome announcement made ending the requirement to access or re-access the asylum procedure by attending at either Croydon or Liverpool, yet this very afternoon I am reliably informed that a new arrival in Glasgow was told by Home Office staff to get a bus to Croydon, essentially, to make an asylum claim.
Without support from the Scottish Refugee Council, that individual would be street homeless tonight.
That is clearly undermining, rather than helping, the public health approach.
We need the Home Office to look at all asylum processes and procedures, and reporting requirements, interviews and other appointments must all be suspended.
We need to look at the state of the asylum accommodation, and at the rules about why asylum seekers who have medical skills are being prevented from working at this particular time.
We need to look at asylum support and at support for providing accommodation to the destitute and the homeless.
Fourthly, the proposed new schedule would make provision for those whose visas are about to run out or whose visas have already run out but are prevented from travelling home.
Many Members will have been contacted by constituents with concerns about people in that situation.
There were reports today about an 80-year-old Ukrainian woman whose visit visa has just expired.
Her solicitor phoned the Home Office and was told that she should consider driving home.
Clearly, asking an 80-year-old woman to return to Ukraine by car is simply ludicrous.
It is time, as our proposed new schedule suggests, for the Government to put in place an automatic extension of leave to remain, at least until September or later, depending on the advice the Government get from medical officers.
I pay tribute to all those who have pushed the Government to accept a more limited time period for the extraordinary powers provided for by this Bill, including my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West (Joanna Cherry), while at the same time ensuring that there can be an extension, with appropriate scrutiny and approval by this House.
We support the principles behind new clause 2.
The provisions that impinge most on civil liberties deserve the greatest of scrutiny.
I also pay tribute to the hon. Member for Bradford West (Naz Shah) for tabling amendment 66, and we are grateful to the Government for listening to her concerns.
Finally, every Member who has tabled amendments to prompt the Government to go further with their provisions to support workers and the self-employed has our solidarity.
The measures announced on Friday by the Chancellor were, of course, hugely significant and very welcome, but we are all being contacted by self-employed people whose costs are not going to disappear in the same way as their incomes in the weeks ahead.
We await urgently to hear the Chancellor announce what further support will be provided.
Even if the Government cannot accept our amendments, I hope that Ministers will listen carefully to all the constructive advice that has been offered and act on it urgently.",4832

2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a138.2,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25385,Naseem Shah,Labour,Shadow Minister (Equalities Office) (Women and Equalities),0,"I would like first on this occasion to pay my respects and put on record my thanks to our brave NHS staff, our key workers and everyone in our nation playing their part in combating the covid-19 outbreak, and also my advance thanks to the police, who have been given extra responsibilities by the Prime Minister this evening to police people’s social distance when they go out.
I will not be moving my amendment, but instead thank the Government for their amendment, which actually strengthened my proposal.
However, it is still important to say a few words about that.
I have been truly heartened by the cross-party support that I have received in this process from every part of this House.
It really does demonstrate how, at times of crisis, democracy can work and can respond positively to the concerns out there in the community.
I would like to say thank you for that spirit of unity.
This truly is a difficult time for everyone in our nation.
They are not normal times with today’s emergency Bill.
We know how life as we know it will have to change, and the origins of this Bill have caused huge distress to religious communities, especially those of Muslim and Jewish background.
Death is a sensitive time for everyone, and losing a loved one is difficult for us all.
We all want dignity in death for our loved ones, and the idea that, in extreme circumstances, when capacity issues arise, the deceased would have to be cremated was something hard to bear, especially for those from the Muslim and Jewish faiths, which strongly oppose cremation.
I further thank the Minister for clarifying in the assurance and the guarantees that she has just given that nobody will be cremated against their wishes.
The aim of my amendment was to give, in such difficult circumstances where capacity issues arise for local authorities, further legal protection and to ensure that the next of kin and the relevant faith institutions were consulted, in order to provide added support and protect the deceased from being cremated.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank my hon. Friends the Members for Ilford South (Sam Tarry) and for Bedford (Mohammad Yasin) and the hon. Members for Wycombe (Mr Baker), for Wakefield (Imran Ahmad Khan) and for Bury South (Christian Wakeford) for co-sponsoring my amendment, and the more than 110 cross-party MPs who formally showed their support.
I also thank the all-party group on British Muslims for its tireless work behind the scenes, as well as community organisations such as the Muslim Council of Britain, the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, Wifaqul Ulama, the British Board of Scholars and Imams, and the Board of Deputies of British Jews.
I thank individuals such as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood), who could not be here tonight; Qari Asim MBE, the adviser to the Government; Mohammed Shafiq of the Ramadhan Foundation, Vakas Hussain, and all those individuals and organisations who played a huge role silently in the background, influencing and putting in tremendous effort to work through this process.
I have never done a campaign like it in 24 hours.
I must also put on the record my thanks to Joseph Hayat of British Muslim TV for doing the one-minute video, which was absolutely amazing.
I also thank the Government and many in the Conservative party for their contributions.
Lord Tariq Ahmad made efforts to ensure that concerns were seriously recognised, and my Muslim sister in the House of Lords, Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, ensured that community nerves were calmed while conversations and negotiations with the Government took place.
I am grateful to the Paymaster General and to the Minister of State, Cabinet Office, the hon. Member for Norwich North (Chloe Smith), for recognising the concerns of all religious communities and taking them on board through the amendment the Government tabled on this issue.
Finally, I would like formally to thank all those from faith communities across the country who lobbied their local MP to support my amendment.
I hear from some of my colleagues that their inboxes are rather full, so perhaps we lobbied a bit too much.
This campaign shows that, in times of crisis, we in politics, in Parliament and as a nation can work together to ensure that we support all citizens.
From Scotland to Bradford West and right across the nation, faith communities play a vital role as the fourth emergency service, providing food, medicine and other necessities to those most in need.
The Bradford foundation trust in my constituency has developed a coalition of more than 50 local businesses and 30 voluntary and community sector organisations, with support from Bradford4Better, to support our local authority during this difficult time.
While faith communities are playing such a vital role, we must not neglect the rights of their deceased.
That would have been a grave injustice.
Government amendment 52 recognises those rights and provides legal protection for the deceased of Muslim and Jewish communities, requiring their wishes and faith to be shown due regard, to prevent cremation.
In some ways, it is clearer and goes further than my amendment.
It provides protection to those from faiths where people choose to be buried and to those who choose to be cremated.
I therefore do not press my amendment 66 and will support Government amendment 52 to provide this much-needed addition to the Bill.",3829

I will be brief.
I want to speak to new clause 5, in my name.
As we have heard, there have been calls from across the UK to look out for the members of our society who are elderly and vulnerable.
I wish to add my voice and to say that the victims of modern slavery must be addressed urgently.
I spoke to the Minister’s colleague earlier today, and I have received assurances from the Minister.
I welcome the fact that the Department is working closely with the Salvation Army, which is the contractor dealing with these issues.
I have faith that it will do the right thing and look after these people, but it is important to issue guidance on this issue when possible.
I recognise that the Department is pressed and that officials are working hard on this issue, but I really hope the Government will be able to address my concerns, particularly to ensure that the victims of modern slavery continue to receive special payments; that where their key worker is off ill due to the virus, someone else will liaise with them and keep in contact; that there are arrangements to address the need to protect them when they are in shared or cramped accommodation, as is often the case; and that the Government will look into these matters and ensure that these vulnerable people, who are already victims, are not further victimised or isolated as a result of a lack of capacity to deal with these issues and concerns at the moment.
I am looking for that assurance, and I hope the Government will be able to issue guidance along the lines I have suggested in new clause 5.",1060
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a145.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25820,Munira Wilson,Liberal Democrat,"Liberal Democrat Spokesperson (Transport), Liberal Democrat Spokesperson (Health and Social Care)",0,"I rise to speak in support of the amendment and new clauses that my Liberal Democrat colleagues and I have tabled.
We are not seeking to divide the House, but we are keen to put our concerns on the record.
In the interests of time, I want to focus on two areas—social care and the self-employed.
There is unanimity in the Chamber about the fact that exceptional times call for exceptional measures.
It is strange to find myself in violent agreement with the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr Baker) and, indeed, the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis).
In these difficult, challenging times, the measures must be proportionate, strictly time-limited and with appropriate safeguards in place.
I therefore welcome the Government’s concession that the Bill will be reviewed every six months, although our amendment seeks a review every three months, with a full review by both Houses.
I note the concerns about whether we can amend or discard parts of the Bill in each review, and I hope that that will be taken on board by Ministers.
The Bill gives the Government sweeping powers over our civil liberties, and impacts on how we look after the most vulnerable in our society, which is dealt with in our amendment 14 and new clause 14.
Social care provision is inextricably linked to NHS provision—they are two sides of the same coin.
Fast and safe discharge into the community is essential to free up hospital capacity for those who are critically ill.
The system is already stretched to breaking point, and many people think that care standards are on the border line.
The Bill seeks potentially to lower standards, which could be dangerously reduced, putting many elderly and disabled people of all ages at risk.
Although the Secretary of State told me that the provisions seek to do the opposite by enabling local authorities to prioritise, I fear that the only safeguard is the European convention on human rights, resulting in many vulnerable people being harmed.
They must not be cast by the wayside in this crisis.
The Bill has been introduced to tackle a serious threat, but it potentially raises another threat for the most vulnerable people in society.
The Chancellor made it clear that he would give the NHS whatever resource it needed to deal with coronavirus.
The same commitment must be given to social care, as the sister service to the NHS.
Amendment 14 seeks to address that very point.
I turn to new clause 13, on statutory self-employment pay.
The Chancellor has rightly stepped in with a far-reaching set of economic measures to support the millions of people across the country whose livelihoods and incomes have been decimated by the pandemic.
.
As many Members from all parts of the House have said, the 5 million self-employed and freelancers feel that they have been completely overlooked.
With over 11,000 self-employed people in my constituency I, like many others, have been inundated with hundreds of emails, from childminders to event organisers, to tradesmen and women, to musicians and those who work in the TV industry, begging for action.
Many have seen their incomes dry up overnight, with no prospect of knowing when they might be able to work again.
New clause 13 seeks to provide for the self-employed on the same terms as the wage guarantee scheme for employees.
I fully understand that the mechanism for delivering such a provision is not straightforward for Government, but let us not let the best be the enemy of the good.
The situation is urgent for millions of people across the country who are struggling to put food on the table for their families and keep a roof over their heads right now.
In 2008, the Government stepped in to bail out the banks.
Now it is time to do the same for everyone whose livelihood is under threat, whether employed or self-employed.
At this time of national crisis, of course we support the Bill with an extremely heavy heart, but I implore Ministers to take on board our grave concerns, particularly on care of the vulnerable and providing for the self-employed.
Let us make sure that not one single provision in the Bill is in place for a minute longer than it has to be.",2728
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a146.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/13864,Jim Shannon,DUP,"Shadow DUP Spokesperson (Human Rights), Shadow DUP Spokesperson (Health)",0,"First, let me thank the Government for their contribution and highlight the plight of the NHS staff who do not have enough protection gear.
Will the Minister ascertain whether any factories can be used to assist in the interim?
I have also been approached by someone about whether, in relation to new clauses 3 and 4, those with an HGV licence could step in to drive supplies—due to a DVLA technicality, they are precluded from doing so.
Can we lift that restriction legally, as it is only a technicality, and allow him and others to step in?
The shadow Minister referred to the 80% of wages being available by 1 April, but may I implore her to make that money available from March?
On new clause 4 and factories producing the food and medication we need, I am thinking of TG Eakin in Comber, producing colostomy bags.
They cannot go home; what help is in place for them?
On new clauses 9 and 11, what about the self-employed?
I have electricians with no premises because their jobs consist of fixing electrics in homes and businesses; can they access the business grant?
I have self-employed café owners who have been asked to close their businesses—their staff are getting a wage, but they are not.
What is being done to help them?
What about a constituent who has a shop stocking cleaning products and basic groceries who is delivering cleaning products, potatoes, milk and other things free of charge?
What help is there for him and his staff in new clauses 9 and 11?
The business grant will only pay his rent for a few months, so how does he feed his five children?
Lastly, self-employed people should get a basic wage when we are telling them to close and when they cannot reasonably stay open.
Again, I would ask what has been done for those who are self-employed.
New clause 8 is about education: what about self-employed coaches who are essential in day-to-day life to the mental health and physical wellbeing of our children?
What about agency staff working in colleges and the civil service?
Do they qualify for the 80% wages that they should under new clauses 9 and 11?",1842

As someone who has campaigned on the “Transforming Care” agenda and the Government’s failure to implement it over many years, I know that there are people the autism community and among those who support people with learning disabilities who are very worried that the Bill could result in further unnecessary admissions to hospital.
This could happen both indirectly, through the withdrawal of support for autistic people and people with learning disabilities, resulting in a higher incidence of crisis, and directly, through provisions in the Bill that make it easier for people to be detained.
Any institutional setting where large numbers of people live together has increased risk of covid-19 spreading.
Families who have battled for years to get their loved ones out of hospital are very frightened that the Bill could mean that their loved ones end up being detained once again, and that if this happens they might also fall victim to covid-19.
Once again, I want to seek assurance from the Secretary of State for those families that their loved ones will not end up once again in settings that have been traumatising in the past and where abuse has taken place, as a consequence of the Bill.",750
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a147.1,uk.org.publicwhip/person/24775,Yasmin Qureshi,Labour,Shadow Minister (Justice),0,"Earlier, I asked the Minister about cremation and I know that she gave me the assurance that no one would be cremated or buried against their religious wishes.
However, with all due respect, assurances from the Minister are not the same as provisions in the Bill.
The Bill still says that it is “desirable” to ask for views and to do something, but unless the body of the Bill actually states that nobody can be buried or cremated against their religious wishes, the law as it stands is that that is not compulsory—the idea is only advisable or only something to do with consultation.
I say that because currently the legislation is that someone cannot be cremated without the consent of the person.
The precise reason why the Government introduced the legislation was so that they could circumvent that by putting in the provision saying it is “desirable”.
In a court of law, “desirable” is not the same as saying “you must” or “you cannot cremate or bury somebody unless they wish that to be so”.
That is the kind of guarantee that is required in the body of the Bill.

I hope that Members across the House understand that when we ask the Secretary of State probing questions, we do so constructively—not to undermine him or to create some false dividing line for the sake of political point scoring.
This is a frightening time for our constituents and we all have an interest in ensuring that the Government get this right.
We want the Government to succeed in defeating this virus.
I will make a few remarks about where we are with responding to the virus before moving on to some specific comments about the Bill.
As always, our thoughts are with those who have lost loved ones to the virus.
Again, let me put on record our praise for the extraordinary efforts of our NHS staff and other dedicated public servants.
This unprecedented global health crisis tests each and every one of them like never before; we are forever in their debt.
Today this House is being asked to make decisions of a magnitude that I simply would never have dreamt of only a few weeks ago.
I know that no Member came into this place to put powers like this on to the statute book—powers that curtail so many basic freedoms that our forebears fought so hard for, and that so many people today take for granted.
But I also know that every Member here will want to do all they can to support all means necessary to save lives and protect our communities in the face of this virus.
This is a global health emergency the like of which the world has never seen since the Spanish flu outbreak over 100 years ago.
Throughout this outbreak, I have said that the virus spreads rapidly, exploits ambivalence and thrives on inequality.
The Government have quite correctly sought to promote social distancing as a means of reducing person-to-person transmission of the virus.
For the most part, these measures have been on a purely voluntary basis, but I am afraid that too many people are still not following the advice.
This weekend we will all have seen the pictures of bustling markets, packed tube trains, and busy beaches and parks.
I am afraid that the public health messages are still not being heard loud and clear.
Everyone who can be at home should be at home.
Everyone who can work from home must do so.
This House must also send a clear message to young people—millennials—that they are not invulnerable to the virus; they are at risk too.
To be frank, we in this House need to adjust our behaviour as well.
I love and respect this Chamber, and I think Members will agree that I relish the cut and thrust of robust debate across these Dispatch Boxes.

I represent an inner-city seat, and I appreciate that her seat is on the outskirts of London but, none the less, our seats have similar demographics.
I know full well that many, many families are living in cramped, small flats.
There are intergenerational families living with elderly mums, elderly grandmothers and so on who have various comorbidities and who need to be shielded.
If we enter a situation in which we force people to stay at home, I hope the Government will look at how to support such families, because it is quite outrageous that, in many parts of the country—especially in London, but also in my constituency—there are flats with families of nine or 10 people sleeping on the floor, and so on, while property developers have flats standing empty.
Why cannot we take over some of those empty flats to house some of these very vulnerable families and to help us get through this national crisis?",478
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a53.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25120,Jon Ashworth,Labour,Shadow Secretary of State for Health,0,"The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right.
We are asking people, and are probably on the cusp of probably of forcing people, to radically adjust their behaviour in a way in which we have not been used to for more than 70 years.
The last time that we asked people to radically adjust their behaviour was in the second world war.
We have generations who are not used to this.
We are a society who are used to going where we want, buying what we want, doing what we want and socialising when we want, and clearly, for a lot of people, it is not dawning on them that they will have to change the way they behave.
That has huge knock-on effects for how public services will be organised, how the criminal justice system will have to work and how food distribution systems are going to work.
It is right that we as parliamentarians continue to ask Government Ministers serious questions about that, but we also have to be aware that we have a responsibility to set an example to the country.
We have to socially distance ourselves, so I really hope that the good offices of the Speaker, the Leader of the House and everyone who is involved in House business can quickly find a satisfactory set of procedures for us to continue having our discussions and asking Ministers questions, but not setting the example that we are unfortunately setting today.
I am not making any personal criticism of any Member, because it is the situation we are in—we have to debate the Bill today—but we are going to have to hold the Government to account on the far-reaching, extensive powers that they are taking.",2619

Throughout all this, given the way in which the virus has spread so rapidly, its reproduction rate and the mortality rate, I have always urged the Government to take a precautionary principle approach to every decision that they make.
I have been a bit sceptical about some of the behavioural modelling that has been used.
Let me give him a quick example.
Before the Government banned mass gatherings, we were told by Ministers and officials—I hope that no Minister takes this is a personal criticism; I certainly do not mean it in that way—that there is no point in banning a football match with 70,000 people in the stadium, because the person with the virus is not going to infect the other 70,000 people in the stadium and that if we stop them going to the stadium to watch the match, they would all go to the pub to watch it and infect more people there.
I am sure he has heard that example.
I am very proud to represent Leicester City football club, and all the football fans—or a large proportion of them—go to the stadium before the match, and go to the stadium after the match—[Hon. Members: “Pub!”]
I beg your pardon, they go to the pub.
They go to the pub before the match, and they go after the match—[Interruption.]
Some of them do avoid the stadium, actually.
I am sure that the right hon. Member for South West Wiltshire (Dr Murrison) sees the point I am making.
Some of these behavioural models do not always, it would seem, reflect how humans behave.
Given that, Ministers and Governments should follow a precautionary principle at all times.
That is why Labour is now urging Ministers to come forward with their plans to enforce compulsory social distancing.
There are different models in different countries—we have France, Spain and Italy, New Zealand, where they did it overnight, Greece, and Germany, where, other than families, they have banned more than two people from meeting outside the house—but we think that the time has come for the United Kingdom to go down this line.
We would encourage the Prime Minister to come forward with plans for how he thinks that this should apply to the UK.",3228
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a54.1,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25120,Jon Ashworth,Labour,Shadow Secretary of State for Health,0,"The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, and I totally agree that that is an absolute disgrace.
I hope that the Government will look into that, because although foodbanks should not be necessary in this day and age, we know that they are vital and I hope that the Government can resolve that swiftly.
I was originally answering the point made by the right hon. Member for South West Wiltshire so long ago: we would support the Government if they came forward with such proposals, but suppressing and defeating the virus is about more than just so-called lockdowns and enforcement.
We need more testing, we need more contact tracing and we need more isolation to break the chains of transmission.
The World Health Organisation has famously instructed the world to test, test, test—and we agree.
Labour has called for testing for the virus to be carried out in our communities on a mass scale, starting with NHS and care staff as a priority.
We urge the Government rapidly to scale up testing and we thank all NHS lab staff and PHE staff who are working so hard.
For example, could the Government consider what is happening in the Republic of Ireland, where there are 35 community testing facilities in operation?
They have six more planned, and the largest, in Croke Park stadium in Dublin, provides a drive-through service that tests 1,000 people a day.",879
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a55.1,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25120,Jon Ashworth,Labour,Shadow Secretary of State for Health,0,"My hon. Friend is absolutely right.
Path lab and virology labs are under intense pressure, because not only are they being asked to test for covid-19 but they have other testing responsibilities as well, whether that is for HIV, influenza, measles or all the other illnesses that are still circulating and still need to be treated.
He makes a very important point.
I hope that Ministers can update us on testing capacity, because looking at the figures it appears that between 21 and 22 March, we did around 5,500 tests, but the previous day we did 8,400 and the day before that about 8,100.
I am told that many labs at hospitals have not been able to start testing or are testing at under planned capacity because there are now supply chain issues with the chemicals that are used and the kits to do the testing.
If this is the case, could the Government update the House on what they are doing urgently to procure the testing kits we need, and explain why we are not part of the EU joint procurement initiative on testing kits and other equipment?
I emphasise the point I have made in this House before that we really need to be testing our NHS staff.
Not testing NHS staff puts them at risk and it puts their patients at risk.
This weekend, we heard powerful messages from doctors who were literally shouting out for help and telling us they feel like lambs to the slaughter because of failures in the distribution of protective kit and because they are not able to get access to testing.
I have heard of GPs—indeed, GPs have got in touch with me directly telling me this going to DIY stores to make their own PPE kit.
It has been reported today that one of the healthcare distribution chains has put out a call to DIY stores asking them to donate or hand over their visors and goggles.
Pharmacists are worried that they cannot get through to CCGs to get appropriate PPE when sick patients are walking through the door daily asking for advice.
We have heard stories of community nurses, health visitors and paramedics without PPE.
Indeed, The Daily Telegraph reports today about staff at Norwick Park Hospital being forced to wear bin bags because of a lack of PPE.
The health, happiness and lives of our constituents, and of their loved ones and neighbours, depend on our NHS staff now more than ever.
We should not expect our NHS staff to go into battle exposed and not fully protected—lacking the armour they desperately need.
If more PPE has been delivered in the last 24 hours, as the Secretary of State indicated, then we welcome that, but to be frank, it should not have taken so long.
Our NHS staff deserve every ounce of support we can offer, and on that front, will Ministers also consider binning hospital car parking charges for NHS staff at this time of crisis?
Those working in critical services more widely—our police, our careworkers, our postal workers—need appropriate protective clothing too.
We urge the Government to ensure that all public services can access the appropriate PPE speedily.
For example, in The Sunday Times yesterday, it was reported that flights continue to arrive at Heathrow from Italy, Iran and China.
Those flights are obviously coming from hotspots—perhaps Ministers could explain why that is still happening—but what protections are being afforded to airline and airport workers, and what measures are in place for those passengers on arrival?
On the tube and on the train, there is real worry that services are being reduced too steeply, causing our key workers to get on to crowded carriages and putting everyone at risk.
What assurances can Ministers give us that there is a sufficiency of public transport services to get our frontline workers safely to their workplace?
Let me turn to some of the specifics in the Bill, and first to the health and social care clauses.
On the health clauses—the hon. Member for Twickenham (Munira Wilson) raised this with the Secretary of State—the Bill makes provisions for retired staff and final-year medical and nursing students to rejoin or join the health service for the duration of the pandemic.
We understand why, and we welcome this.
Can Ministers tell the House, either in response to the debate or in Committee, whether final-year nursing and medical students will be able to return to learning and complete more supported clinical placements, if needed, once the crisis is over?
Will Ministers also outline how these students will be fully supported while working during what will undoubtedly be an incredibly stressful time for new doctors and nurses?
Will students be properly remunerated for their work, and what protections will be available for retired staff, many of whom could also be in a vulnerable group?
I put on record our thanks to those retired staff who have returned to the frontline.
Some of the most vulnerable people in the country absolutely depend on all of us here to defend their human rights and civil liberties, and they are the ones in receipt of adult social care services.
On social care, this Bill makes sweeping changes to the duties that are placed on local authorities.
It removes the duty to assess care needs, including on discharge from hospital, so there will be no duty to assess people who may need care or to assess their carers, and no duty to assess some of those with the most severe needs who may be eligible for continuing healthcare.
Can Ministers reassure us that this will not mean that carers, disabled people and older people are left abandoned by the state until after this crisis?
Most significantly, the Bill downgrades the level of support that councils are obliged to provide to older and disabled people.
Rather than the current wellbeing measures, councils will now have to provide services where necessary to uphold people’s basic human rights.
In short, this means people will only be entitled to receive social care to keep them alive and to uphold their rights to privacy and a family life.
Obviously, that is not the vision for social care that we legislated for in 2014, but we all appreciate that these are incredibly difficult times.
Many older and disabled people, and their families, will be concerned that this will lead to existing care packages being significantly reduced overnight.
Local authorities are already struggling to meet statutory needs, and increasing levels of workforce absence will only make that harder.
None of us wants to see the new legal minimum of support become the default.
Where local authorities can provide more comprehensive packages of support, they should, and they should always bear in mind that people who use social care are not simply passive recipients; there are doctors and nurses who rely on social care, as well as teachers, shop staff, food manufacturers and countless other vital professionals.
When councils reduce care packages, they must be careful not to end up causing yet more difficulties for staff in crucial services.",5648
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a57.1,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25120,Jon Ashworth,Labour,Shadow Secretary of State for Health,0,"Absolutely.
That is why these particular clauses must be scrutinised so carefully by Members across the House.
We have tabled amendments to schedule 11.
We recognise that there will be difficulties delivering social care over the coming weeks and months, but it should not be possible for local authorities to immediately drop care packages to a lower level.
As long as it is reasonably practicable to do so, they should continue to meet people’s care needs.
The presumption should always be that services will be disrupted as little as they can be under the circumstances.
Nothing in our amendments would stop a local authority cutting back care hours if it had to, but they would mean that disabled and older people could be reassured that any reductions in their care will be a last resort, and that their independence will not be the first sacrifice to be made.
There are particular concerns about people who live alone or are being held in in-patient units and care homes.
We have seen visits to those settings stopped as part of the Government’s shielding approach, and the CQC has halted all inspections, but we know from incidents such as Whorlton Hall that is too easy for abuse to go unnoticed—something the current situation could make worse.
How will we ensure that in-patient units and care homes do not become hotbeds of abuse of human rights over the coming months?",962
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a57.3,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25120,Jon Ashworth,Labour,Shadow Secretary of State for Health,0,"The right hon. Gentleman is right: we cannot just have a take-it-or-leave-it approach to these things.
Tonight, the House will give the Government extraordinary powers, like we have never seen before, and it is right that we parliamentarians are given an opportunity, after the appropriate timeframe, to look at how those powers have been used and hold Ministers to account.
I agree with the spirit of the point he makes, although I cannot at this stage—I suppose it may emerge later in the debate—give him a commitment one way or the other on a particular amendment.
We will see how the discussions proceed throughout the afternoon, but I certainly endorse the spirit of what he says.
As I say, these are extraordinary powers that the House will grant the Government this week.
We have tabled a new clause related to schedule 11.
We propose that a relevant body, such as the Equality and Human Rights Commission, should be tasked with overseeing the Bill’s impact on the provision of social care.
That body would have to report every eight weeks on the operation of these changes and whether they should be amended.
It would provide the oversight that is needed to prevent people’s rights from being undermined.
One of the ways the Bill seeks to free up medical staff is by relaxing the requirements of the Mental Health Act 1983.
Specifically, only one medical professional will have to agree to someone’s being sectioned, rather than the two it currently takes.
The scale of that change should not be underestimated.
No longer will a decision to section a person have to be taken in consultation by two doctors.
There will be no requirement for anyone involved to have had prior involvement with the patient.
Medical professionals are going to be under huge pressure in the coming months, and mistakes may well be made.
The Bill says that a decision should be taken on the basis of one signature if requiring a second signature would be“impractical or would involve undesirable delay.
”That seems to be too vague and potentially open to misreading.
I hope Ministers can tell us what exactly that means and what safeguards will be put in place to prevent the change from being misused.
Our amendments to schedule 7 would narrow the provision so that a second signature could be left off only if acquiring it would mean an undesirable delay.
If something is impractical, it will by definition create an undesirable delay.
By narrowing the wording in the Bill, we can avoid the potential misuse of powers.
We propose changes to ensure that private mental health hospitals cannot detain someone solely on the single recommendation of one of their employees.
That could create a conflict of interest whereby a doctor comes under pressure to sign a detention authorisation because doing so will provide their employer with income from the NHS.
No medical professional should be put under that kind of pressure, and our amendment would ensure that they cannot be.
[Interruption.]
Is the hon. Member for Bracknell (James Sunderland) seeing to intervene?",2749
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a58.1,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25120,Jon Ashworth,Labour,Shadow Secretary of State for Health,0,"The Bill extends to five days from three the length of time for which somebody in hospital can be held waiting to be sectioned.
That may seem like a minor change, but for the individual concerned it could make a significant difference.
I hope Ministers can reassure the House that the intention should still be to adhere to the timetable set out in the Mental Health Act, with the changes we are discussing to be used only if absolutely necessary.
Let me turn to some of the proposals on education and schooling.
Many parents of children with special educational needs and disabilities will understand the need for flexibility during this difficult time, but they are also extremely nervous that they could see the erosion of the hard-fought-for rights of disabled children and young people, children and young people with special educational needs, and their families.
The Bill gives the Secretary of State powers to change section 42 of the Children and Families Act 2014: rather than giving children rights in law, it would only request that public bodies take “reasonable endeavours”.
That sets a low bar, and we will seek to change that provision to a duty to take all practical steps, which will go much further.
Let me move on to some of the other issues in the Bill.
Others have alluded to concerns that the Bill still does not go far enough in providing people with the incomes that they need to self-isolate.
We welcome much of the Chancellor’s statement last Friday setting out plans to support the incomes of workers impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.
However, there are still some gaps in the provisions that were offered.
Currently, the proposal for income support through the job retention scheme does not include the self-employed and freelancers, whose incomes are increasingly being seriously affected by the coronavirus outbreak.
Will the Government today offer assurances to those groups of workers, who do not have a safety net to safeguard and help them through this time?
We have welcomed the new Government measures to improve access to statutory sick pay for workers.
However, the Bill does not extend eligibility to all workers, including the just under 2 million workers who earn less than the qualifying threshold of £118 a week on average.
It does not raise the level of statutory sick pay, which is, at £94.25, already the second lowest rate in Europe.
We hope the Government will respond on those issues quickly because, as we have continually said throughout this crisis, people should not be expected to make a choice between their health and hardship.
Nobody should lose their home because of this virus.
It is welcome that Ministers have listened to Labour and committed to an evictions ban for renters,
but despite the Prime Minister’s promises that the Government would legislate to that effect, no such measures are in the Bill.
Some 8.5 million households rent their home from a private, council or housing association landlord in England.
Our analysis of Government statistics shows that 6 million renting households have no savings at all and are particularly vulnerable if they lose their job or have their hours cut as a result of coronavirus.
To give people confidence and reassurance during this difficult time and to ensure that no renter loses their home as a result of coronavirus, rent needs to be suspended for those adversely affected by the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
Like many Members across the House, the Opposition support this Bill with a very heavy heart—heavy not just with the shock and grief that this deadly virus has brought, but given the very real threats that emergency powers of this nature pose to human rights.
The Bill contains the most draconian powers ever seen in peacetime Britain—powers to detain and test potentially infectious members of the public, including children, in isolation facilities; powers to shut down gatherings, which could impede the ability to protest against the overall handling of the crisis or against the abuse of the powers themselves.
It needs no explanation and very little imagination to understand the huge potential for abuse that such powers and others in the Bill, however well intended and needed, still give rise.
Those words will chill every liberal and libertarian instinct of Members across this House, which is why we were grateful to the Health Secretary and the Solicitor General for discussing these measures with us and with my shadow Cabinet colleagues in the rapid preparation stage of this Bill.
We have heard many wartime analogies in the press.
Many here have talked about Winston Churchill.
Of course, Churchill was remembered not only for victory in the war, but for the European convention on human rights at the end of the war.
Notwithstanding the anti-Human Rights Act and anti-judicial review grumblings that we have heard in recent times, this Bill comes under the cover of a statement of compatibility under section 19 of the Human Rights Act.
Further, the Bill does not attempt to oust the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts.
That means that every exercise of Executive power or administrative action under the legislation must and will be measured against human rights and common-law standards.
These include necessity, proportionality, rationality, fairness and, crucially, non-discrimination.
I thank the Government for that concession on their part and for agreeing, I hope once and for all, that human rights and the rule of law, far from impeding national efforts in time of crisis, should instead guide and inspire them.
It is important that various measures in the Bill, some interfering with liberties and others deregulating standards, may be turned on and off, as and when needed, by the appropriate Administration under our devolution settlement.
It is welcome that the Bill contains a two-year sunset clause, but as we have discussed, two years is a very long time in normal days and longer still in the context of this pandemic.
That is why we tabled an amendment last week seeking parliamentary votes on the renewal or revocation of these emergency powers at six-monthly intervals.
Indeed, many of us would prefer even more frequent reviews, but given the particular challenge even for Parliament of this crisis, I am glad that the Government seem to have moved some way towards the compromise offered by the Opposition in the constitutional interest.",4566

Gentleman makes an interesting point, to which I am sure Ministers will respond in Committee, when we get to that point later.
I hope the Government will be able to explain the differences between their amendment and ours, and to reassure the House that there will not be large exceptions to the six-monthly review, especially in England, which has only this House to hold Executive power to account.
We have been scrutinising the Bill on behalf of our constituents.
None of us came into politics to put a Bill like this on the statute book, and I for one will never rest until the day comes, hopefully not too far away, when I can come to this House and vote to get to get rid of it.
But what we have seen in recent months is concerning, if not frightening, all our constituents, and it is right that we are taking the powers that we are taking today, although we have to continue to hold Government to account.
We will overcome this virus, and when we do, serious lessons will have to be learned.
The crisis has exposed the vulnerability of a society in which insecure work is rife, deregulation is king and public services are underfunded.

I hope that people listen to his wise words, which come from his experience; there was an awful lot in his speech that was sobering.
The way we are conducting this debate and the collegiate style of the contributions from the Secretary of State and the shadow Secretary of State are a testament to the importance of the crisis we are all experiencing.
In this national emergency, the desire shared by all our constituents is that we all work together.
I will begin by saying something that is often repeated, but cannot be said enough.
On behalf of all who sit on the Scottish National party Benches, I thank all of those who work in our NHS—our doctors, our nurses and all those in support roles around them who day after day make the choice to go into work, literally risking their own health to save the lives of others.
At a time when the fragility of human life occupies the thoughts of us all, their example, their care and their limitless compassion are a source of inspiration and comfort to us all.
They are nothing short of heroic.
In return, they deserve all our thanks, but even more important, they need all our support.
Today we would all do well to keep it in mind that the primary purpose of the emergency legislation is to help them—to help those who work in our NHS across all these islands.
They need our help to slow the spread of this virus.
They need our help to flatten the curve of infection.
They need our help to reduce the pressure on their services.
In passing these emergency measures, we have to be fully transparent and open.
That means being honest about the uncertainty of the timeline ahead.
There are few things we can say for certain, but we know we are only in the foothills of this mountainous challenge.
There remains a long way to go.
We have to be honest that in fighting this virus, we may only be approaching the end of the beginning.
No one knows for sure when this will end, but we do know that NHS and governmental action will not be enough on its own.
Everyone has a part to play.
We can get through this and overcome it only if we all work together.
On the specifics of the Bill, first, I am pleased to confirm that the Scottish Government have worked constructively with the UK Government on this legislation.
It is important to say that, given the context of the last few years.
It is no secret that there has been a virtual stand-off in other legislation, but the joint efforts and the extensive co-operation on this Bill highlight the extraordinary public health and economic challenges posed by the virus.
Passing this legislation is fundamentally about protecting and saving lives.
Politics cannot and will not be allowed to get in the way of that.
The Scottish Government tabled their legislative consent motion, with advice to approve consent, in Holyrood last Thursday.
The LCM will now be considered by the Finance and Constitution Committee at Holyrood on Tuesday morning, and will be debated in the chamber on Tuesday afternoon.
The urgency of that timeline is, unfortunately, necessary.
It is clear, and we accept, that this Bill cannot be scrutinised in the way we would normally wish.
The immediacy of the pandemic, and the unprecedented challenges facing Scotland and the rest of the UK, simply does not permit that.

It is for that reason—the extremity of this time—that we welcome the measures in the Bill.
They are the measures that we need to fight this virus.
The breadth of measures contained in this legislation reflect the enormity of the challenge across these islands.
They also include bespoke provisions for Scotland to reflect our different legal system.
For the public looking on today, it is crucial that we explain fully the powers that are being discussed and sought, and the reasons for them.
They include additional public health measures to assist with the containment or mitigation of the spread of disease.",2016
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a67.1,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25361,Ian Blackford,Scottish National Party,SNP Westminster Leader,0,"Give me some time and I will.
The part of the world I live in, the highlands, needs the powers in this Bill if we are to protect our population, and I know that the same goes for the constituencies of many other right hon. and hon. Members, not least the hon. Member for St Austell and Newquay (Steve Double), whom I know has been outspoken on this in the past few days.
Let me put on the record the challenge we are facing.
The Highland Council landmass is 25,656 sq km, and of course that area does not include Argyll, the Northern Isles or the Western Isles.
That Highland Council area makes up 32% of the landmass of Scotland and 10.5% of the UK landmass, yet we have one acute hospital, in Inverness.
For many, that hospital will be more than three hours’ drive from home.
Just think about that.
If a hospital in an urban area has an issue with capacity, people can often be transferred to another hospital, but we do not have that opportunity in the highlands, as we have that one hospital.
I am asking everyone who is thinking about coming to the highlands to think about that threat to our NHS.
I have been working with the NHS and talking to the police, and on the back of what we have been witnessed over the weekend I would like, with the forbearance of the House, to read out a press release from the chief executive of NHS Highland yesterday.
It stated:“As a community we in the Highlands, Argyll and Bute are friendly, welcoming and hospitable to the thousands of visitors we get all year every year.
However, we are currently in a situation that has never been experienced before and for the first time we are making a plea for you to stay away.
We have heard that there are many people using campervans/motorhomes to make their way to the Highlands and Argyll and Bute as a way to self-isolate during this period.
Please don’t.ational advice is quite clear that we, as a nation, need to stay at home, self-isolate and stop all non-essential travel.
This includes using our area as a safe haven.
We have asked our communities in NHS Highland to do everything they can to stay safe.
This includes self-isolating, working from home (where possible), and limiting their contact with the outside world.
”That is a very clear and a very stark message.",2965
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a68.1,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25361,Ian Blackford,Scottish National Party,SNP Westminster Leader,0,"That is the height of irresponsibility, and Amazon and anybody else who would behave in that way needs to think again.
Of course there are companies that are engaging in best practice.
I have had a number of complaints from people in the highlands about those who have not been doing the right thing, but let me thank Highland Experience Tours, which has suspended all its activities and sent its drivers home.
The hon. Member for Ilford North (Wes Streeting) mentioned Sykes Cottages, and I have to disagree with what he said, because its behaviour has been absolutely reprehensible.
Let me read to Members what Sykes Cottages sent to me on Saturday.
It said, “Given concerns surrounding the current outbreak, it is understandable that people want to arrange private accommodation in more remote locations to distance themselves from larger towns and cities.
The latest Government advice does not prohibit travel in the UK.
We are continuing to provide a service for customers.”
That is a service to customers to come from the urban areas; it is deliberately creating the circumstances whereby their customers should come to self-isolate in an area where we have limited public health capabilities.
That simply is not good enough.
I am delighted to say that, under pressure, the site has now relented and is stopping new bookings in the highlands and islands over the next few weeks, but it has sent a considerable number of people up to the highlands who are there today.
The site should be delivering immediate advice to all those guests that they should return home to their place of origin.
I give the same message to those with holiday homes and second homes in the highlands: “Do not come to the highlands.
Do not put additional pressure on our public services.
We will welcome tourists back to the highlands once this emergency is over, but do not threaten the health of our constituents.”
In my district, like in many rural areas, 35% of the population is aged over 65.
We have to think about the needs of those living in such areas.
In addition to the sites I have mentioned, Cottages.com is refusing to allow cottage owners to cancel bookings without a penalty, which is simply not good enough.
As this is now in the public domain, I hope all these providers will now think about their responsibilities.
As I have mentioned, some providers are behaving more responsibly.
HomeAway has guidance on its booking site for giving refunds to those who cancel, but I will read one last email from somebody living in the Lake district:“My family and I were due to take up a holiday home rental from the 28th March.
We will stay away and remain in the Lake District where we live.
“
My family and I were due to take up a holiday home rental from the 28th March.
We will stay away and remain in the Lake District where we live.
However you might be interested to learn that the owner of this holiday home, let through HomeAway, is refusing (at present) to cancel my booking, refund my payment of £957 or move my reservation to next year.
He maintains that Skye is an ideal place to self-isolate…and as the home is available he is refusing to refund the total of my booking fee.
”[Interruption.]
I can hear an hon. Member shout, “Shocking.”
Skye, or anywhere else in the west highlands, is no place for anyone to self-isolate, and I hope this cottage owner, and others who are behaving in such a reprehensible manner, changes their ways.
Of course, it is not just those who are providing accommodation.
Everyone knows about the Harry Potter films and the attractions of the rail line from Fort William to Mallaig.
The steam trains, which operate on a regular basis, are due to start on 6 April.
What on earth is the Jacobite steam train company thinking?
These train trips, along with every other visitor attraction in the west highlands, must close, and they must close today.
This Bill includes badly needed powers to allow more health and social care workers to join the workforce.
That includes removing barriers to allow recently retired NHS staff and social workers to return to work, as well as bringing back those on a career break and bringing in social work students to become temporary social workers.
It has to be said that the number of doctors, nurses and carers already seeking to re-register to help in this emergency has been one of the most uplifting stories of this crisis.
The Bill allows that process to become much easier.
Its provisions also allow for the relaxation of regulatory requirements within existing legislation to ease the burden on staff who are on the frontline of our response.
The next few weeks and months need simply to be about saving as many lives as possible.
Try as we might to save these lives, unfortunately the truth is that this virus will inevitably end up with many of our people dying before their time.
That terrible reality is why it is right that this legislation includes special arrangements and provisions to manage an increase in the number of deceased persons with respect and dignity.
Finally, something my party has raised repeatedly since the early stage of this crisis is the economic interventions required to help our people though this emergency period.
I note that the legislation includes provisions to support the economy, including on statutory sick pay, that are aimed at lessening the impact of covid-19 on small businesses.
While we have welcomed many of the measures brought forward by the Chancellor, we have put it on record that more needs to be done.
The self-employed and the unemployed, whom we talked about earlier, need to be considered.
They are under pressure and they need to know that we have got their backs.
They need the security of a guaranteed income.
We now have an opportunity to overhaul and fix the universal credit system—ending the delays, uprating the level of support and scrapping the bedroom tax.
If we are to fight this virus together, we must ensure that everyone is supported equally and that no one—no one—is left behind.
The emergency and extensive powers in this legislation have rightly raised questions and concerns, many of which we have heard this afternoon.
The imposition of measures that will significantly alter individual liberties deserves full and frank scrutiny, no matter the context.
We know that the Bill sunsets after two years.
However, there are serious concerns over the two-year period and the scrutiny of this measure.
I know that aspects of the Bill and amendments to it will be discussed at later stages.
I hope that the Government will look carefully at the safeguards of regular reporting, review and renewal if it is required.",8159
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a70.1,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25361,Ian Blackford,Scottish National Party,SNP Westminster Leader,0,"I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that that would be a very good way forward.
It is important that we enact the Bill, but the House must have oversight of it in the period ahead.
I commend him for his approach.
The Scottish Government have pledged to have appropriate reporting on how and when they will use the powers in the Bill.
They will embed such reporting and renewal in law.
They have stressed that the creation of these additional powers does not mean we will automatically be required to use them.
I hope the UK Government follow that lead and give assurances in the remaining stages this evening.
The emergency powers and the extent of the legislation demonstrate what all of us are faced with.
This is not a normal time.
Unfortunately, the truth is that none of us will live normally for some time to come.
As the First Minister has said, if individuals are continuing to live normally, they need to ask themselves if they are following all the scientific advice.
The sheer speed of the spread of this deadly virus has shocked us all.
It has naturally made us reflect on the way we live and the vulnerability to which we are all exposed.
Equally, it has demonstrated our dependence on one another.
We live in an ever smaller world and the major challenges we all face are the same; we can only face them together.
The provisions in this legislation are about saving as many lives as possible during the biggest health emergency this planet has faced in 100 years.
If we do not take immediate and unprecedented actions, we will be responsible for putting people at risk.
If we act fast, we know that we can save thousands of lives.
It is as simple and as clear as that.
Never has a more important responsibility been placed upon all of us.
Saving these lives must be our sole focus.",1956
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a72.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/24905,Bill Esterson,Labour,"Shadow Minister (Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy), Shadow Minister (International Trade)",0,"I entirely agree with the right hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Theresa Villiers) about the message we should give to our constituents.
We have to support health workers as a priority and we have to support all essential workers, and we have to make sure that everything we do delivers that objective.
I want to say a few words about information.
We need information clarity.
One of the problems we have had over the last few weeks has been the change in the information and advice given by the Government and others.
What the right hon. Lady has said is exactly right: stay at home, stay 2 metres away from everybody else, wash your hands, and protect those health workers and essential workers so they can look after us.
I do think we are going to need more stringent measures, and need them soon.
I will focus the remainder of my remarks on the financial measures.
The Bill references sick pay, but 4.7 million self-employed workers, many of whom have lost their entire work, do not qualify for sick pay, and the same applies to a further 1 million company owners.
It is essential that the Chancellor brings forward measures that deliver sick pay, yes, but also a package for our self-employed workers, as the Musicians Union has suggested, which means the real living wage.
It has suggested £400 a week initially, and an equivalent 80% figure based on previous years’ earnings.
This is to put the self-employed in a similar position to the package the Chancellor suggested for employees on Friday, which I think was a very important step forward.
There has to be rent and mortgage provision that does not put people into arrears.
It is no good pushing people into debt and making life more difficult.
I say these things because if people are not financially secure, they are more likely to make risky decisions and try to go to work, and to act in a way that is counterproductive to achieving the objectives of supporting our health workers and reducing infection.
Another point put to me by many self-employed workers is that insurance is simply not working.
Provision has to be in place for business interruption and for income protection, as those policies are being regarded as not valid by the insurers.
I have had many constituents and business organisations coming to me, including the example of a self-employed couple who already cannot put food on the table.
The other point I want to make is the importance of actions being taken quickly.
The Government need to say for employees, as well as announcing the package for employers, exactly how people are to access the funds.
How do businesses get the money quickly so they can carry out the income replacement schemes?
Given that it will not apply in March, there is a risk that hundreds of thousands of workers will miss out because businesses will not survive.
There are additional costs that have to be covered—the costs of rent, insurance and utilities—and many businesses simply will not be able to cover those costs to be in a position to take advantage of the measures announced on Friday.
This is about speed of access, making sure the schemes are available and that the cash gets through as quickly as possible, and that does mean this week.
I am glad that the Paymaster General is taking notes on these points.
On the loan scheme that has been announced, the banks are saying that they want personal guarantees.
That is going to stop businesses taking out loans, and the loans that might have delivered cover for those other costs are simply not going to be viable for too many businesses.
That is another aspect that needs sorting out.
There is so much detail that needs attention, and I appreciate that, but the schemes need to be up and running.
Emergency workers, especially in the health service, need everyone to be able to stay at home.
The schemes need to be implemented, and information from the Government needs to be clearer.
The Government can now take advantage of advert breaks because the commercial advertisers are not going to be using them.
Let us get the information out there on the telly, on the radio and on social media about how people can access these schemes and about staying safe out there.
Let us make sure these schemes are in place quickly to look after people in employment and self-employment.",4040
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a79.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/10155,Edward Davey,Liberal Democrat,"Liberal Democrat Spokesperson (Treasury), Liberal Democrat Spokesperson (Social Justice), Acting Leader, Liberal Democrats",0,"I would like to begin by thanking everyone who is working hard to keep our country and our world as safe as possible from this dangerous pandemic.
Above all, I want to thank the staff of our NHS and our social care sector.
We are seeing people face personal risks, and we will forever be grateful for what they are doing.
In normal times, I and my party would be opposing many of the measures in the Bill with every breath in our bodies.
The implications for civil liberties and human rights are profound and alarming, but our society now faces the unprecedented threat of coronavirus, which leaves some of the most vulnerable in our society at serious risk.
It seems clear that at least some of the new powers being sought by the Government are necessary to deal with the threat.
Nevertheless, our position is that the powers must be used only when absolutely necessary during this emergency, and not for a moment longer.
Like others, I welcome the Government’s change of heart on the two-year renewal.
The six months now proposed is, self-evidently, a significant improvement.
Nevertheless, we remain unclear why it is six months rather than three months.
There may be good reasons, but it is important that the Government set out why they chose six months.
After all, the Prime Minister said just the other day that the peak of the epidemic would be just 12 weeks away, so it is not unreasonable to ask why six months is needed.
Moreover, we need to look carefully at the review process.
When it comes, it should enable amendments to this law, and the other place needs to be allowed to vote on it too.
Let me give one reason why a more frequent renewal process should be considered.
It relates to the Bill’s provisions on social care.
The Bill temporarily suspends the duties on local authorities to meet people’s care needs—from older people to adults and children with disabilities.
I am yet to be convinced that those provisions are needed at all.
They are some of the most alarming provisions in the Bill.
At a time when the most vulnerable in our society need more care, not less, why on earth are people’s rights being reduced?
At the very least, such a reduction in rights for the elderly, disabled and mentally ill must be subject to early review and renewal.
The right hon. Member for South West Surrey (Jeremy Hunt) was right to raise the issue of personal protective equipment and testing.
NHS staff who have contacted me are angry and alarmed at the lack of PPE.
They do not understand why the distribution system has taken so long and is still failing to provide PPE for so many people.
The testing experience in this country compares appallingly with other countries.
There are other problems with the Bill.
Due to the time, I will mention just one: the Bill’s failure to enable the Government to extend the Brexit transition period.
I know that is politically sensitive and contentious.
I know we need to bring our country together after Brexit tore us apart, so I do not seek to reopen the Brexit question, despite what my heart tells me.
I raise the Brexit transition period as a practical and real issue.
Our economy faces its biggest challenge since the second world war—disruption to business on a scale even greater than would have been caused by the worst-case scenario of a no-deal Brexit.
Surely, the Government should think again and allow themselves to extend the Brexit transition period.
We on the Liberal Democrat Benches will support the Bill tonight, but with a very heavy heart.
We hope the Government will come back and allow the House to ensure that we can protect our country against this coronavirus threat but not ditch our civil liberties and human rights.",3475

When I indicated to some constituents and even members of my family over the weekend that I was coming to London today, they thought I was mad.
They think that, collectively, we should not be here.
They point to the information that we give out and the leadership that we show and wonder why we are here.
But when I reflected that my brother, a consultant in the NHS, will be going into hospital to face these acute difficulties on the ward, and that his wife, my sister-in-law, and tens of thousands of members of our national health service—not through bravado or machismo, but because they care—will be turning up to work today and in the days and weeks to follow, I decided that we could do our duty and be here today.
It is a tribute to our institutions and our democracy that, even though parts of this legislation will curtail our freedoms, we are here, and it is important that we put on record our gratitude for all those who are stepping up at this time.
The shadow Secretary of State for Health raised the subject of parking charges at our hospitals.
I also want to raise that, because I think it is totally abhorrent that, in the face of such adversity, we are expecting people to not only turn up to work at hospital but pay for the privilege of parking there.
I know that all these issues will be devolved and will fall to different trusts and commissioning groups across the country.
I want to put on record my appreciation to the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust for its decision to waive parking charges for staff members in all the Belfast facilities.
I ask the South Eastern trust, which is responsible for the Ulster Hospital in my constituency, to take exactly the same measure.
We need to be supporting people through this.
When I attended a pharmacy on Friday, it could only be described as a warzone.
They asked why they were left without sufficient pharmacists, and in that regard I welcome the extension for new registrants in clause 4.
They were saying, “We can’t sell paracetamol.
We have run out.
You cannot use anti-inflammatories in this situation.
Our stores are filled with 100-packs of paracetamol, and yet we are legislatively precluded from breaking them down and giving them to people who need them.”
They said, “The Government say that we have a home delivery service to get prescriptions out to those in self-isolation, but it is an unfunded and overstretched service, and our vans run on diesel, not good will.”
There are huge challenges in every aspect of our society through this crisis that the Bill alone will not resolve, but it is an important first step.
I want to place on record my appreciation for not only the Government’s engagement with us over the last week but the substantive nature of the Bill.
There is hardly a clause of the Bill that does not replicate provisions for Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.
Officials have performed a mammoth task over the last number of weeks, and we need to put on record our appreciation to them.
I want to raise an issue with the Paymaster General, and I hope she will be able to give clarity on two specific points.
As she will know, clause 13 covers continuing healthcare assessments and clause 14 covers local authority care and support in England and Wales, while clause 15 relates to Scotland.
That is the one part of the Bill where I see no corresponding provisions for Northern Ireland.
I mention that not to raise concern, but because there are people out there who are advocating on behalf of charities and who have children in a vulnerable situation or with mental capacity issues who feel that that means they will not get the care they need.
Can she respond appropriately to that, to alleviate their concerns?
Madam Deputy
Speaker, I am grateful for the time.",3558
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a86.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/11360,Liam Byrne,Labour,"Shadow Minister (Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) (Digital Economy)",0,"I would like to begin where many hon. and right hon. Members have begun, by putting on record our profound thanks to the volunteers and public service workers who have done so much.
The definition of the frontline is the point of maximum danger, and there are hundreds of thousands of people who have put themselves in danger to keep the rest of us safe.
There is one group I would like to single out: the extraordinary group of people at Heartlands Hospital in my constituency who have been working tirelessly to help to keep our city of Birmingham safe.
It was Ernest Hemingway who said that the definition of courage is grace under pressure.
Well, our volunteers and public service workers are under pressure today like never before.
Their skill, their care, their compassion, their grace, and their courage are something that will live in the memory for generations to come.
There are two issues with the Bill that I want to touch on.
Those issues are protections that are needed, but which are missing from the legislation—one on the income side and one on the cost side.
On the income side, the challenge now for Her Majesty’s Government is to begin quilting together the patchwork of measures that have been so rapidly put in place.
There are five groups whose household income will come under severe pressure very quickly: those who are in work; those who are self-employed; those who are newly sick; those who are newly unemployed; and, of course, those who are having to take parental leave because the schools are now closed.
The Government have moved quickly to put in place wage subsidies, and that is good and welcome.
I add my voice to those who tonight are calling for rapid measures to help the self-employed, but we also need to address three other areas in the income protection system.
First, we need to ensure that the rate of statutory sick pay quickly moves up to about £160 a week.
It is very difficult for people to live on the extent of the pay cut that they have taken just because they are ill.
Secondly, paid parental leave now needs to kick in from day one, and that has to be enforceable as a statutory right.
Thirdly, for those now labouring on universal credit, that payment has to go up to at least £100 a week.
A couple in my constituency with two kids will now be £800 a month below the poverty line if they were having to live on universal credit.
That is simply not acceptable, and we are going to have to improve that situation.
The second protection that is missing relates to costs; I mentioned this earlier in comments I made to the Leader of the House.
Some companies are behaving very badly.
For example, individuals such as Philip Green laid off thousands of staff before the income protection system kicked in.
He should be summoned to the Bar of this House to explain himself.
Staff in Topshop are telling me that they are being prohibited from circulating the petition that I have launched to have him summoned here to explain himself.
Of course, we also need rapid protection in price regulation.
In times of emergency, prices go up.
I have been inundated with complaints after Jhoots Pharmacy in my constituency raised the price of Calpol from a couple of quid a bottle to 20 quid a bottle.
Markets need morals in times of emergency more than at any other time, and we now need rapid action to put in place the price regulation that I have proposed in new clause 28, which has been widely shared and supported by Members across this House.",3982

I welcome the content of the Bill and the work that the Government are undertaking.
.
But I want to focus my remarks on housing, because there are massive holes in today’s proposed legislation when it comes to protections for the millions of people who rent, not own, their home.
I am basing my remarks on the amendments that have, in the last 15 minutes, been published by the Government.
We have absolutely no time properly to scrutinise them.
These are very difficult times for all of us in this country, but the risk of losing one’s home is surely too much to ask anyone to bear at this time, on top of everything else.
The Government themselves have acknowledged that with their action on mortgage holidays.
The Labour party, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey) in particular, published draft legislation last week to protect renters, which would have gone much further than the Government have gone today.
There is an overwhelming case for action: 20 million people in England rent, 6 million of whom have no savings whatsoever.
Last week, Shelter estimated that 50,000 households could face eviction through the courts in the next six months, and those evictions do not include large numbers of section 21 no-fault evictions.
We have heard of landlords threatening to evict health workers because of the risk of their exposing others to the virus.
More alarmingly, some of the 1.5 million people the Government have written to and told to stay at home for 12 weeks could face eviction notices over the coming weeks.
Astonishingly, today’s amendments do not get us to what the Government promised last week, which is a three-month ban.
They simply extend the notice period for evictions by one month.
That means that, over this entire period, eviction notices will still be landing on people’s doormats.
They simply will not be evicted until June instead of May.
It is really clear what we need.
We need three things: a real ban on evictions for six months; suspension of rents to defer rental payments and allow repayment over a further manageable period; and a substantial increase in support for rental costs through the social security system.
Although I broadly welcome the work that the Government are doing, it would be frankly disgraceful for Ministers to have promised one thing last week and to have misled renters with a promise to ban evictions, when the reality is nothing like that.
Will the Minister please tell us what he will do for the thousands of families who could be evicted in the middle of this lockdown?
Will we see an immediate suspension of all possession cases?
Shelter has draft legislation in place.
Will the Minister also protect those families in temporary accommodation and bed and breakfasts and listen to the Children’s Commissioner’s call and pay attention—",2173

I would like to commend the speech by the former Health Secretary, the right hon. Member for South West Surrey (Jeremy Hunt), in which he pointed out the very effective action that has been taken in a number of Asian countries.
I associate myself with the thrust of his remarks, which is that we need to take very clear and determined action as fast as possible, given the circumstances.
That means obviously much tighter social distancing measures and a much more active approach by the state.
It also requires, as he pointed out and other speakers have said, the need for effective PPE and other supplies to get to our hospitals as soon as possible.
I should say that I have heard of cases in my own area—not in my constituency, but nearby—where there are real concerns about this.
We do need to look at what works and what has worked around the world in tackling this dreadful problem.
There are examples where action has been taken immediately and it has constrained the spread of the virus.
I am very pleased that the Prime Minister has now pivoted: he has listened to the World Health Organisation advice and he has taken the UK on a different track.
We have a very narrow window of opportunity to stem the worst of this crisis.
We have seen what has happened in Italy and in many other countries on the TV news, and we do not want to see that in this country.
I would urge everyone to support the measures that are being taken forward.
However—I am conscious of time—I have some reservations about this Bill.
I would like to echo the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth) and by other Members around the House about the need for consent, for protection of the needs of vulnerable people and for greater thought to be put in.
I urge the Government to take on board the points made across the House today.
The spirit of the debate has been extremely constructive.
The Minister is nodding and I know she is thinking about this matter.
Please take on board the need for wider social consent, for effective review mechanisms at six months at a minimum, and for a further ability for Parliament to bring it back within a year, if possible.
I urge Ministers to consider that.
I am conscious of time and grateful for the opportunity to speak.",2696
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a95.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25375,Imran Hussain,Labour,Shadow Minister (Justice),0,"There is no doubt in this House that the situation we are facing is unprecedented in living memory.
The raft of measures we are debating this afternoon would be unspeakable in any other situation outside wartime, such is the challenge we face.
The Government have my support in implementing measures to help keep us all safe from this hidden enemy.
I share the concerns of Opposition Front Benchers about the impact on the self-employed, those who are disabled and frontline NHS staff.
Time not permitting, I will make one point that has been raised with me by a number of constituents about schedule 27, which suspends protections that prevent the cremation of an individual regardless of their wishes or faith.
The right to faith and dignity in death is one of our most inalienable rights and one on which we must never compromise.
How our physical bodies are handled and treated after our death is a core tenet of all faiths.
That is why I wrote to Public Health England some time ago to express my concerns about how the deceased may be handled during this emergency, and why I was alarmed to learn of the measures in the Bill that overrule the right to faith and dignity in death by permitting a local authority to cremate an individual against their wishes.
While I acknowledge that the Government have this afternoon taken a step in the right direction and shown that they are listening to and engaging with faith communities by making it clear in law that faith must be taken into account before a decision on cremation is made, there is still some confusion as the provisions still appear to allow a local authority to cremate an individual against their wishes where there is a lack of capacity, either locally or in the immediate area, for handling the deceased.
The Government must this afternoon address that confusion and make it clear that the absolute right to refuse the option of cremation is upheld in their amendment and in Government policy.
The Government must also make clear their commitment to ensuring that all local authorities have sufficient capacity to handle an increased number of deaths.
On that point, I pay tribute to the work of Bradford Council over recent days and weeks to build additional capacity to handle deaths in a faith-compliant manner, to ensure that in Bradford we never have to compromise on the right to faith and dignity in death.
As the leader of Bradford Council has firmly set out:“Those of faith where burial is a prerequisite will always have that wish respected, and that will always be Bradford Council’s position in all circumstances.
”I think that point should be put clearly on the record.
In short, our Muslim and Jewish faith communities are rightly concerned about the measures in the Bill and want firm assurances from the Government—assurances I urge the Government to provide today—that they will never compromise the rights to faith and dignity in death.
Those are fundamental and absolute rights, and they are non-negotiable.",1507
2020-03-23,Coronavirus Bill,a96.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25310,Helen Hayes,Labour,Opposition Whip (Commons),0,"I recognise the need for emergency legislation at this time to minimise and reduce the harm and devastation that covid-19 threatens for communities across the country.
I rise today to speak on behalf of the millions of people who are currently receiving social care, those who are in need of social care but whose needs are not currently being met, those who will need social care for the first time because of the impact of covid-19, and children with special educational needs and their families.
These are already some of the most vulnerable groups in our society.
Many are also in the vulnerable category for covid-19 due to age or comorbidities.
They are also exceptionally vulnerable to the social and mental health impacts of the pandemic.
In suspending all of the rights of older and disabled people under the Care Act 2014, there is a significant risk that some vulnerable people will have care withdrawn as resources are prioritised and that some will be left in truly desperate circumstances.
I am concerned that in his opening speech, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care appeared to say that the purpose of the measure was to ensure that people’s life-and-death social care needs would be met over those who currently have a statutory entitlement, but for whom it was not a life or death issue.
In my experience, it is simply not the case that, for anyone who is able to access social care in one way or another, it is not a matter of life or death.
What assurance can the Minister give that the needs of those already eligible for care under the Care Act 2014 will continue to be met?
We need greater clarity from the Government on what criteria will be used to allocate social care resources at this time and how individuals can trigger a review of decisions made about their care under this Bill.
I am also concerned that the Bill could result in what little progress has been made on the “Transforming Care” agenda for people with autism or learning disabilities being undone, that the withdrawal of support for autistic people and people with learning disabilities could result in a higher incidence of crises, and that, because of the provisions in the Bill, more people could end up being detained and back in institutions that have been traumatising and where abuse has taken place.",1501

I am conscious that, on a Bill of any importance, I would usually be addressing a packed Chamber.
However, I thank those Members who are not here and have stayed away for reasons of social distancing.
They are doing the right thing, and they are still standing up for their constituents.
We have heard some powerful speeches from hon. and right hon. Members.
I thank my right hon. Friend the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Liam Byrne) and my hon. Friends the Members for Sefton Central (Bill Esterson), for Rhondda (Chris Bryant), for Coventry South (Zarah Sultana), for Newport West (Ruth Jones), for Croydon Central (Sarah Jones), for Reading East (Matt Rodda), for Bradford East (Imran Hussain), for Dulwich and West Norwood (Helen Hayes) and for Bolton South East (Yasmin Qureshi) for their contributions.
I also commend the hon. Member for High Peak (Robert Largan) for his maiden speech.
He said that his parents were unable to watch it from the Gallery, but that at least they could watch it on television.
I am sure they were very proud, and I wish him well in his time in the House.
This Bill will change our everyday life in profound ways.
Freedoms we have enjoyed over generations will be curtailed.
As my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth) set out, in this public health emergency the Opposition are supportive of the Bill as a necessity to mobilise resources effectively, but most importantly of all to save life.
Our thoughts are with families who have lost loved ones in the global pandemic.
At this time of crisis, the public interest requires that we consider extraordinary measures that only a few weeks ago were unthinkable.
We have to ensure, though, that the arrangements are fair and just for everyone.
Social distancing and isolation but must be accompanied by guarantees of access to the basic means of living: food, fuel, income and housing.
For every sacrifice expected from our people, there must be an equally strong imperative on Government to protect and provide for them.
Nobody should have to choose between their own wellbeing and the nation’s public health.
Nobody should lose out for doing the right thing.
I will set out in more detail in Committee the measures that we suggest to improve what the Chancellor has suggested.
As we ask many people to remain at home, with all the effects that has, let us remember, too, those who do not have a home to stay in and are on our streets, in need of our protection.
Let us thank all those who have been working for the good of others in the most difficult of circumstances—our brilliant NHS staff, caring and compassionate; the teachers who, with school closures imminent, continue to do their very best for our children with dignity and determination; all our local government workers, keeping vital services going; and our shop workers, who have kept going, sometimes in difficult circumstances.
But words of gratitude are not enough.
The Government have to make sure that protective clothing and equipment is available to every single person who needs it, and there must be ventilators, too, for every patient who needs them.
In time of peril, it is right that people look to Government and elected representatives for leadership.
It is when Government is at its most powerful that it needs most scrutiny.
I am pleased to see the certification on European convention on human rights compliance and the fact that this Bill will be subject to the supervision of our courts, but a two-year sunset clause without regular scrutiny was not enough.
I welcome the Government’s concession to move to six-monthly votes,
, but the general view of the Chamber is that if it could be made clear that any votable motion is amendable, it would make it clear that certain individual elements of the Bill could be switched off as well.
In 1939, the then Government passed emergency legislation to deal with total war, and that required renewing annually.
Times have changed now and we are not in a battle with other countries.
Rather, we stand together in the values of our common humanity to drive back the coronavirus disease, which threatens us all.
The Government’s focus must be on diverting resources to this colossal national effort, but that should not mean that duties to people already in need completely fall away and that hard-won rights over many years are lost forever.
New legal minimums of support should not be a default.
Care packages should not automatically be cut back to the minimum required, those with special educational needs must have the care they need and those with disabilities must have their rights protected.
The Government must make clear its value—in action, not words—for everyone who relies on support.
Life will return to a sense of normality in the not-too-distant future, but we are asking for changes in our way of life.
There have of course been negative stories—in the course of this debate, the shadow Transport Secretary has sent me a photo of workers in a canteen in Teesside clearly not respecting social distancing—but alongside those there are also great stories of the very best values of our society.
Hearing the famous “You’ll never walk alone” played simultaneously on radio stations across the world summed up where we are.
We must not let this period be defined by isolation.
I think of the grandparents not seeing their grandchildren as they otherwise would and of the people whose attendance at community events kept them going, but being separate does not mean that people have to be alone.
In this age of modern technology, we must use all the means at our disposal to keep talking, to stay together.
I say to anyone watching this: if you do nothing else this evening, contact somebody who is on their own to show them that.
The late Aneurin Bevan, who created the national health service, which we will need more than ever in the weeks ahead, wrote:“Not even the apparently enlightened principle of the ‘greatest good for the greatest number’ can excuse indifference to individual suffering.
There is no test for progress other than its impact on the individual.
”There can be no other test for this Bill and the financial measures that go with it than how it protects every single individual person.
Let this be a time of togetherness across our United Kingdom, with us all determined to get through this.
Let us look out for each other and set an example across the world.",5939
2020-03-24,Covid-19 Update,b241.2,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25120,Jon Ashworth,Labour,Shadow Secretary of State for Health,0,"I thank the Secretary of State, as always, for advance sight of his statement.
As he knows, yesterday we called on the Government to move to implement the enforcement of social distancing measures, so the Prime Minister was quite right last night to call for people to stay at home.
May I put to the Secretary of State a few quick questions?
The virus thrives on inequalities.
It is the most vulnerable, without financial security, who are especially at risk.
I therefore urge him to consider abolishing prescription charges for the duration of the outbreak, especially for those with conditions such as asthma.
We are very mindful of the mental health implications of asking people to stay at home, and we are also deeply concerned about the potential for domestic violence to increase.
What support is available on those two fronts?
We also need clear and unambiguous advice around which workers can and cannot go out.
The Opposition would call for just key workers to be able to go to work.
We have seen Sports Direct, for example, insisting that its workers turn up today.
We are hearing stories about warehouses insisting that agency workers turn up and about construction sites not putting in place social distancing measures.
That is putting workers at risk, and it is putting the lives of us all at risk.
We need clear enforcement; if we are telling people that they will be fined for leaving their house, why are we not fining employers for insisting that their employees turn up to work when they should be staying at home?
My right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor will be putting more points to the Government about income protection in the debate later today.
Let me quickly turn to personal protective equipment.
I understand the efforts the Government have made, but there are still NHS staff saying that they have no access to adequate PPE.
We still have hospital chief executives expressing concern that they do not have access to FFP3 masks, that they are not getting the visors and sanitisers they need on time and that, when they do get masks, they are different from the previous masks, so staff have to be retrained.
I urge the Government to move heaven and earth to get the PPE our staff need to the frontline.
We also need PPE in social care.
We are beginning to see outbreaks of covid-19 in social care homes.
What support is in place for the residents of care homes, and when will we get the PPE that we need into the social care sector?
Enforced social distancing is welcome—we called for it—but in many ways it is a blunt tool without ramping up testing and contact tracing.
EThat is how countries such as South Korea have managed to suppress the virus.
We are still testing only around 5,000 people a day.
We do not have enough community testing.
We are still not testing enough NHS staff.
As the World Health Organisation has instructed the world, test, test, test.
Leaked emails today suggest that, on Sunday, the Government were asking to borrow research institutions’ testing kits—we have called for that, and we do not disagree with it—but the emails also said that the Prime Minister had said:“there are no machines available to buy”.
Many of our constituents, and indeed NHS staff, will be asking why we did not procure machines and kits sooner.
On intensive care capacity, there are reports today that the ExCeL centre will be turned into a field hospital of 500 beds and that staffing ratios for intensive care are being relaxed.
We understand that, given the staffing demands we face,
, but if we are setting up more field hospitals, will the Secretary of State tell us what oversight there will be?
That change also means that more of our specialist staff will be stretched further—we understand why—but what guidance will be in place?
Will the Secretary of State update the House on how many intensive care beds are now open, and how many more will be opened; how many ventilators we have, and how many more will be purchased; how many beds with oxygen we have; and what the current extracorporeal membrane oxygenation capacity is?
Will the Secretary of State quickly update the House on an issue that has emerged overnight about access to abortion care, as a result of some of the implications of the Coronavirus Bill?
Will he assure the House that women who want access to abortion care will continue to be able to get it?
Our constituents are worried; our constituents are fearful.
I hope the Secretary of State understands that when we put these questions to him, we are doing so because we want the national effort to defeat this virus to succeed.",3670
2020-03-24,Covid-19 Update,b245.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25278,Owen Thompson,Scottish National Party,SNP Whip,0,"I extend our continued thanks and gratitude to all who are working around the clock to help keep us all safe, and to look after us and the most vulnerable in our communities.
I also extend our thanks to the millions of people who have already acted on the Government’s advice to stay at home.
The importance of that cannot be stressed nearly enough, because that is what we all need to do to protect our friends and families and the vulnerable people in our communities.
It is deeply unfortunate that some employers, such as Sports Direct, seem to be acting in an entirely irresponsible manner, and I welcome the Secretary of State’s comments about that.
In looking to see what more we can do, will the Secretary of State outline when he expects all frontline NHS staff to have the PPE that they need?
We need to do everything we can to support them, given the extent of the risks that they are facing.
How many additional ventilators have we managed to procure since the Prime Minister put out the call to manufacturers?
Are the Government planning to accept the EU’s offer to share in central procurement of ventilators, testing kits and PPE?
Scotland has a number of qualified doctors and nurses who arrived in the country during the refugee crisis.
Will the Secretary of State commit to talking to the Home Secretary about what possible actions could be taken to relax the existing rules, to allow those qualified medical professionals to support the country that they have adopted as their home?
In the light of the outcome of the Keeling study, which was published by the Government on 20 March, is the Secretary of State ensuring that we have rapid and effective contact tracing?
The review showed that such action could reduce the number of people infected by each case from 3.11 to 0.21, and that would be a significant step towards greater containment of the current outbreak.
Finally, I stress to the Secretary of State the need to impress on other Cabinet members the urgency of finding support for the self-employed, who are still waiting to find out what position they will find themselves in.
We know that people with no financial backing come under pressures that may have an impact on their health, which would put further pressure on the system.",1200

I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement.
My thoughts are with all those who have lost their lives to this horrific virus.
I pay tribute to the NHS staff who have lost their lives.
I hope that, when this is over, we can find an appropriate way to remember the frontline NHS staff who gave their lives for all of us.
May we also remember those social care staff who have also lost their lives?
Will the Secretary of State tell us the actual number of social care staff who have sadly died?
The First Secretary did not have those figures at his fingertips a few moments ago.
It looks like we are heading for one the worst death rates in Europe.
The Government have been careful to always say that they are following scientific advice.
Will the Secretary of State tell us the explanation from the Government’s scientists for why our death rate seems so poor when compared with Germany’s, for example?
Will he undertake to publish the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies’ minutes, which have not been published?
Will he also undertake to publish the evidence on why we are following a seven-day rule for isolation?
That appears to contradict the World Health Organisation, which suggests a 14-day rule for isolation.
As the virus develops, we see that, while it attacks the respiratory system, it also attacks cells throughout the body with ACE2 receptors, leading to cardiovascular and renal failure.
In the same way that the Secretary of State can convene SAGE and other committees, will he convene the clinical societies so that we can share understanding of the disease among clinicians regarding how best to treat the disease as research emerges?
I am sure that the Secretary of State is struck, as I am, by the high proportion of deaths among black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.
We see that in the United States, too.
He has launched an inquiry.
Will he update the House on that and tell us when it will report?
I am sure the Secretary of State is as horrified as I am by the deaths in care homes and nursing homes.
This was always a high-risk sector, which is why we have long called for a social care strategy.
Will he undertake to do four things?
Will he ensure that all deaths are recorded on a daily basis?
The CQC suggested today that the death rate in care homes is double what was reported by the ONS yesterday.
Can he ensure that testing for staff is delivered in care homes at local NHS sites or by mobile units?
It is clearly ludicrous to expect care workers to travel for miles and miles to drive-through testing centres.
Can he ensure that PPE supply systems for the NHS are expanded to the social care sector as well?
The Secretary of State said in the past that the NHS will get whatever it takes.
Will the social care sector now get funding to cover the huge costs that it is facing, which are associated with increased staffing levels and PPE?
I join him in praising the leadership of the NHS for what it has done.
The Secretary of State gave us the critical care figures.
How many general and acute beds are currently empty in the NHS?
If there are significant numbers of empty beds, could they be used for social care residents, or to start a return to elective surgery?
We know that the lockdown is having an impact on people’s wider health.
Cancer patients are going without treatment, and we know that elective waiting lists will rise.
Can he tell us the latest estimates how high he thinks those lists will rise?
There are also bound to be mental health problems associated with the lockdown.
Many people are understandably angry that front-line staff do not seem to be getting PPE on time, and we do not seem to have taken part in some of the European procurement projects.
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that was because we missed an email.
The Secretary of State said that we are now part of that project, but that prompts the question of why we were not part of it at the beginning.
The senior civil servant at the Foreign Office said it was a political decision.
Will the Secretary of State tell us exactly what went on?
Will he publish the background briefing so that we can see exactly what happened?
Finally, I agree that testing and contact tracing are vital to coming out of a lockdown.
The Secretary of State talked about wanting to upscale contact tracing, but that is very labour-intensive.
Can we use the 750,000 volunteers who have signed up to do some of that contact tracing?
The app that he mentioned is welcome.
When will it be available?
Is he proposing that it will be mandatory, or will it be voluntary?
If it is voluntary, how will we ensure that it is taken up by the population?
Will he comment on reports today that the PCR test, which has been used for some NHS staff, returned false results and that those staff had to be tested again?
How many people have been affected by that?
What is now in place to ensure that that does not happen again?
If the Secretary of State cannot answer all those points today, I hope that he will write to me with the details at a later point.",6117

Like everyone, I welcome the stabilisation of covid cases, but does the Secretary of State accept that the testing and contact tracing must be in place before any easing of the lockdown, to avoid resurgence and a second peak?
Will he achieve 100,000 tests a day by next week?
If not, when?
How accurate are the tests?
A 25% false negative rate has been reported.
I know the Secretary of State is a fan of phone apps, so I am glad to hear him recognise the need to increase public health staff both to conduct and co-ordinate contact tracing.

On a consensual note, I very warmly welcome the announcement of funding for the vaccines network—the GAVI programme—which the SNP called for some time back.
I am glad to see we are in agreement on that.
The programme will do a lot of good in the world.
Without getting into the specifics, I echo a number of concerns raised already about repatriation.
I have praised FCO officials, who are working really hard in tough circumstances, but I have to say the statement seems rather Panglossian and does not reflect the experience of a number of my constituents and, I am sure, those of Members across the House.
Will the Minister commit to holding in due course an inquiry into the FCO handling of this issue, so that we can learn lessons for the future, focusing not least on the defunding of the FCO network, which has left it at such a loss that it did not have the capacity to cope with this crisis?
On the procurement aspects, I am struck that the statement makes no mention of the EU procurement issue.
In a quite remarkable sitting of the Foreign Affairs Committee recently, Sir Simon McDonald had to clarify his clarification.
Reading from the letter, he said, quite explicitly, that “Ministers were not briefed” by UK mission on the EU’s joint procurement agreement, but he went on to say:“Owing to an initial communication problem the UK did not receive an invitation in time to join”the EU’s covid procurement response.
Forgive me, but it seems quite inconceivable to me that UK mission did not make London—call it that—aware of the existence of the schemes.
Will the Minister therefore perhaps clarify whether officials in London were briefed by UK mission on the existence of the schemes?
Will he confirm whether the “initial communication problem”, which meant that we missed out on procurement schemes that could have been of value to our constituents, was between UK mission and London or was it within London?
Will he also assure us that the problems have been dealt with and that we will contribute to and participate in future EU procurement schemes?",1981

May I add my thanks to the dedicated frontline staff of the Department for Work and Pensions for everything they have done and are doing during this crisis to ensure that we can process the unprecedented volume of claims that have been made?
I thank the Secretary of State for advance notice of her statement.
May I add my thanks to the dedicated frontline staff of the Department for Work and Pensions for everything they have done and are doing during this crisis to ensure that we can process the unprecedented volume of claims that have been made?
I welcome the measures the Secretary of State has announced so far.
The social security system we had going into this crisis was a safety net with too many holes in it, and it is good that the Government have recognised that.
My questions for the Secretary of State are about how we can widen that net so that everyone who needs support gets it, and about the steps that will need to be taken as we move from response to recovery.
First, the Government have significantly increased universal credit, but people on legacy benefits such as jobseeker’s allowance and employment and support allowance have not seen a corresponding increase in their benefit.
More than 100 charities have pointed out that that discriminates against disabled people in particular.
When will those benefits be uprated?
Secondly, there are now 100,000 families who will not be able to receive this increase because they are still limited by the benefit cap.
The Government say the benefit cap exists to force people to work more hours or move to cheaper housing, both of which are clearly impossible during the crisis.
Almost every organisation, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies to the Resolution Foundation and the Child Poverty Action Group, believes it should be temporarily suspended.
Does the Secretary of State agree?
Thirdly, anyone who has been saving for a housing deposit, for a rainy day or for a substantial item could find themselves ineligible for universal credit because of those savings.
Those people paid into the system when they were in work; should it not be there for them now?
I do not believe we should punish those savers, and I believe those saving limits should also be suspended.
Fourthly, the Government say the two-child limit exists so people supported by social security have to make the same family choices as those who are not, but this crisis shows how absurd that claim is.
People could not have been expected to make family choices three years ago based on the likelihood of a global pandemic shutting down our economy.
The Government have suspended sanctions during the crisis, but the two-child limit is effectively an 18-year sanction on the third and fourth child in a family.
Surely it should go too.
Fifthly and finally, those people who are eligible for support from universal credit will still have to wait five weeks for their money or take an advance that will be deducted from future payments.
Many people do not appreciate that if they claim universal credit before they receive their final salary payment, their income means they have no entitlement for their first month and could have to wait as long as nine weeks for any payment.
Since it was introduced, the five-week wait has been the single biggest driver of housing arrears, short-term debt and food bank use in the country.
It should not exist at all, but in this crisis it is particularly egregious, and it simply must go.
May I also raise a very specific issue with the Secretary of State?
It has come to light that the universal credit regulations treat maternity allowance, which is received mainly by low-paid women, as unearned income but statutory maternity pay as earnings, which are disregarded by the work allowance.
That could result in a low-paid pregnant woman being as much as £4,000 a year worse off.
Why is that?
Will it change?
I turn to preparations for the recovery.
As the Cabinet Minister responsible for the Health and Safety Executive, what conversations has the Secretary of State had with it about the process by which workplaces will be made safe when people are asked to return to work?
When the lockdown began, most MPs were inundated with questions from constituents still in work about whether their workplace sounded safe.
That simply will not do when lockdown ends.
There must be a clear process agreed by the workforce and management, not least because a failure to do so would likely result in significant litigation.
This crisis has confirmed in terms what the UK’s unequal and unfair labour market really means.
Although some people have been able to work from home on full pay, others have faced having to go into work and risk their health, or have lost their job through no fault of their own and will receive social security or sick pay set at just a fifth of the UK’s weekly median income.
More than 4 million British children grow up in poverty, living in poor accommodation and perhaps without the internet connections many of us take for granted.
The lockdown will have a severe impact on their wellbeing.
Many have likened our response to coronavirus to fighting a war.
If that is true, the aftermath should be equally so, with a renewed national effort to fight the inequality, poverty and insecurity that should have no place in this country at any time.",3803

I wish to put on record my thanks to the DWP staff, who are continuing to work hard to deliver social security benefits as quickly as possible in very difficult circumstances, but the circumstances have been made more difficult by the decisions of the UK Government, who have introduced bureaucratic support schemes instead of a far simpler universal basic payment with a longer view towards universal basic income.
Millions have been forced on to still inadequate universal credit, and despite DWP staff being moved to cope with the UC demand, over 200,000 people had their UC claim paid late, according to the UK Government’s best estimate.
Because DWP staff have been moved to help process UC claims, MPs and other advice organisations are not getting casework inquiries answered in the normal way, which is also causing unfair hardship.
On the last day that I contributed in this House—18 March—before lockdown, I said that people needed help in hours, not days, yet the people applying for universal credit in that week will have only just received their first payment a few days ago.
The British Government must finally stop the five-week wait.
They claimed that they cannot solve it by making the advance payment system a grant rather than a loan because of vulnerability to fraud, so why not make the advance a grant when the applicant is confirmed as eligible for universal credit?
I would appreciate proper consideration of that proposal.
Airdrie food bank in my constituency has reported a 47% increase in demand for its services since the onset of covid-19.
That should focus minds.
The Prime Minister said that nobody would get left behind, so why has there not been an uplift in legacy benefits, such as employment and support allowance, as there has been to universal credit?
Finally, will the Government scrap the immoral, poverty-inducing two-child limit, the bedroom tax and the benefit cap, and will they uprate all benefits to make up for the years of cuts that came through the benefit freeze?

It is regrettable that the “stay alert” slogan for England was briefed to the media before MPs and that no consultation with the devolved Governments took place beforehand.

The threat of a second wave remains very real, and the infection rate could move upwards rapidly again.
We only need to look at Germany to observe the consequences of lifting lockdown too soon.
Now is not the time for caveat and nuance in tackling coronavirus.
We need a clear and unambiguous approach like that taken by the First Ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to reinforce the clear message to stay at home.
Lockdown has not been an easy decision to implement, and it does not come without cost.
It has taken its toll on our constituents, and we are all anxious for their wellbeing.
We know that businesses are struggling right now, and we want to support them to survive in the months ahead and rebuild over the longer term.
From hairdressers to shows and everything in between, they need stability now in order to prepare for the post-coronavirus economy.
Just as with the lockdown measures, we must not rush into winding down the job retention schemes that give businesses security now.
Indeed, we must look at options for extending those schemes for sectors that may struggle to reopen with social distancing.
No country is going to avoid the economic impact of coronavirus, but the question comes down to whether recovery puts the wellbeing of society first or tries to carry on as if nothing has happened.
We risk creating another lost generation if we do not learn from the innovations that have been born out of necessity during this crisis.
Flexibility in policy making will be crucial in adapting to the challenges of our post-coronavirus future.
That is as true when approaching the question of easing lockdown measures as it is with many other aspects of Government policy.
A unitary, one-size-fits-all approach has not always been the most desirable approach to managing the crisis.
To take just one example, France has designed its exit strategy on the basis of levels of infection.
The areas of highest infection continue with more restrictions, while areas of low infection see more relaxed measures.",2938
2020-05-11,Covid-19,b52.1,uk.org.publicwhip/person/24851,Rachel Reeves,Labour,"Chair [Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee]",0,"We all know how hard lockdown has been, especially for those who fear for their jobs and their businesses; the elderly; the lonely; and those living with an abusive partner or carer.
At the moment, most grandparents want nothing more than to be able to hug their grandchildren.
Thousands of people are missing out on the chance to say goodbye or even to hold the hand of the person they love in a care home.
The same applies to the ambiguous situation relating to funerals and cremations, which is causing enormous pain and distress to so many families.
It is in depriving us of these poignant moments—opportunities to hug, to hold and to say goodbye—that the impact of the virus causes the most distress.
There are so many profound social costs, and it all has to be balanced with the huge challenges and risks faced by people working in health and social care.
We all want the Government to get this right, but, frankly, the Government’s response in the past 24 hours has been a shambles.
Last Thursday, the Government’s briefings to newspapers led to headlines proclaiming that we could look forward to “Happy Monday” and “Lockdown Freedom”, the day before a sunny bank holiday weekend.
When I saw those headlines, I recalled the world war two poster in my history class at secondary school that said, “Careless talk costs lives”.
I wonder sometimes whether the Government pause to contemplate the health impacts of some of their briefings and statements.
Last night’s statement by the Prime Minister was a chance to provide some clarity about the situation, but it obscured as much as it revealed.
This morning, the Foreign Secretary told “Today” programme listeners that they were free to see both their parents at the same time.
Almost immediately afterwards, it was clarified that people may see only one parent at a time.
The Foreign Secretary then told Sky News that people should return to work from Wednesday, but the press release issued by Downing Street alongside the Prime Minister’s statement clearly stated that people should be encouraged to return to work from Monday.
If senior members of the Cabinet struggle to follow the advice, what are the rest of us meant to do?
A four-nation strategy is essential to ensure a coherent and consistent message.
It has served us well so far, so why is England now pursuing a different strategy from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales?
If someone lives in Bristol but works in Cardiff, should they be going to work?
What about if someone lives in Berwick but works in Edinburgh?
When it comes to Northern Ireland, the Government must also consider cross-border co-operation.
Northern Ireland is unique in that it shares a land border with the Republic, so close co-operation with the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Assembly is vital to ensure a joined-up approach to effectively combating the virus, particularly with regard to contact tracing.
The UK has the highest death toll in Europe.
That calls for greater care, not greater risks.
The most substantive change in Government advice today is that workers who cannot work from home should return to work.
We want workers to earn an income and businesses to thrive, but for that to happen, workers need to know that they and their families will be safe.
Businesses want that knowledge and security as well.
Let us be clear that the biggest risk to our economic security and recovery would be decisions that led to a second peak of the virus, so it is deeply worrying that workers were asked last night to return to work today with no guidelines published with regard to safety in the workplace.
If someone has been told to return to work, but lives with a partner with a pre-existing condition or an elderly parent, what are they meant to do?
What if someone has a school-age child but is now expected by the Government and their employer to return to work without the childcare to be able to do that?
Can people still be furloughed?
Is that at their employer’s discretion?
If people cannot work through no fault of their own, will they be required to go on to statutory sick pay?
Who will assess whether a workplace is sufficiently safe?
Is it up to the individual employee?
I refer the Minister to section 44 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which permits an individual employee not to return to work without risk of detriment if they reasonably believe that adequate safety measures are not in place.
I hope that employers and Ministers will protect those rights.
Meanwhile, workers are told to avoid public transport if possible, but for millions of people in the UK, it is not possible to get to work any other way but by public transport.
We have already seen bus drivers in London lose their lives to covid-19.
People need to know that they can go to work without endangering themselves, or indeed others.
If we are to balance concern for the economy with concern for public health, the Government should bring unions, business leaders and scientists together to develop a national safety standard.
The safety of workers and their families is not, and can never be, an optional extra.
It is vital that the furlough scheme continues to support workers, including enabling people to work part time, particularly if businesses are unable to operate at full capacity.
We need to hear more from Ministers about ongoing support until the time is right to operate at full capacity for some of the hardest-hit sectors, such as hospitality and travel.
We need to support areas such as our coastal communities, which are so dependent on tourism.
The impact of the virus exposes deep inequalities in our society.
The poorest areas of the country have been hardest hit.
Lower earners are most exposed while the better-off are insulated from the biggest threats.
Of the bottom 50% of earners, just one in 10 can work from home.
At the top, it is five times that.
This crisis has shown who the real key workers are, from NHS staff to care workers, supermarket workers, cleaners, delivery drivers and bus drivers.
They are often underpaid, under-appreciated and undervalued, and they have been asked to put their lives at risk while keeping others safe.
Now, more working people who do manual jobs in manufacturing, food processing and construction are being asked to risk their health, and that of their family, while those doing office jobs, which are often better paid, can work from home and face fewer risks.
Black and minority ethnic Britons are disproportionately at risk.
We know that black Britons are four times more likely to die from this virus compared with white people.
We need a public inquiry into that, which Baroness Lawrence called for today, and we need urgent action to protect the most vulnerable from this virus.
Coronavirus did not cause those inequalities, but it has thrown a sharp light on them.
We must not let them deepen even further.
In our care homes the spread of the virus continues and the death toll is still too high.
Half of workers in care homes earn less than a real living wage, and a quarter are on zero-hours contracts.
Many have died.
Last Wednesday, the Prime Minister reported that 29 care workers have died since the start of this crisis, but data from the Office for National Statistics show that there were 131 coronavirus-related deaths among social care workers up to 20 April.
According to the National Care Forum, just one in five care workers with symptoms have been tested, and they still lack priority testing for coronavirus.
Those who dedicate their lives to caring for others, and who care for the sick and the dying whose relatives cannot be with them, are being left without adequate protection, and we are only beginning to know the real cost.
One reason why the lockdown rules are causing so much worry is that new infections and deaths are still at higher levels than when we went into lockdown.
The test and trace strategy is still a mess.
MPs from across the House will have constituents who have been waiting for well over 48 hours to get their results, and some who have been waiting for more than a week.
We see reports of tests having to be flown to the United States because we lack the capacity here.
How did we get into that position?
Without a test, trace, and isolate strategy it is almost impossible to identify a new spike in infections, or to do anything about it.
The Government need to sort that out.
Relaxing lockdown will work only if it is sorted out.
At some point we will come through to the other side of this virus, and we will go about rebuilding our lives, our communities, and our economy.
The recovery will not be easy, and it will require boldness and imagination to build something better.
The contribution of the British public and all our key workers has been immense, but the crisis has revealed huge injustices and inequalities.
We deserve a fairer country—that will be Labour’s mission, and I hope it will be the Government’s mission too.",7331

Unfortunately, the foundation of this crisis has been 10 years in the making.
A decade of Government austerity has taken its toll on health and social care services in England and, through cuts to devolved budgets, right across the UK.
The pandemic is unprecedented in our lifetimes and poses a real challenge for every single Government on the planet, but it has been No. 1 on the risk register in the UK for more than 10 years.
In early February, the Government claimed to be fully prepared, yet more than three months on, they are still failing to supply sufficient PPE to protect their healthcare staff.
Moreover, testing and contact tracing are still not fully up and running, yet they are lifting the current restrictions.
In 2016, Exercise Cygnus highlighted the lack of PPE and ventilators, yet there has been a 40% reduction in the value of the stockpile.
The management of it was outsourced to a private company, and we hear that 45% of items in the stockpile are out of date, including 80% of respirator masks.
Last June, the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group advised the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to add gowns to the stockpile.
Why was that not done?
Is that why Public Health England guidelines, which were issued to all four nations, did not include gowns for staff in covid-positive wards outwith intensive care?
Two hundred healthcare staff have died.
We need to pay tribute to them, but it should not have happened.
None of them were from intensive care units, the most dangerous setting, which shows that full PPE actually works.
But now we hear that even ICU doctors in England report struggling to get gowns.
There is no point in joining the Thursday clap for carers if you are not willing to protect staff.
The excuse for the lack of gowns is that the stockpile was only planned for an influenza pandemic.
This is a civil contingency measure, so why would you plan for only one virus?
It is not as if this is the first coronavirus outbreak.
We had the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2002 and the middle east respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2014, and they were both much more lethal.
The Prime Minister set five tests for easing lockdown.
The Government clearly are not yet meeting No. 4.
Scotland’s NHS has had central procurement and logistics for years and has its own stockpile, but the challenge for all Governments is achieving ongoing supply in the presence of high global demand.
Yet the overseas offices of the Department for International Trade have apparently been advised not to assist the Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish Governments in PPE procurement.
Provision of PPE is a devolved responsibility.
Why would the UK Government want to undermine those Governments’ efforts to protect the patients and staff in devolved health services?
The Secretary of State for Health prides himself on having ramped up testing to 100,000 on 30 April, but that was only by counting 40,000 tests that were, as we say, “in the post”.
I wonder if they are counted again when they come back in.
The level, sadly, has not been maintained.
One issue being reported is delays in getting results back.
It is also the case that the result is not always reported back to the GP or the hospital if it is a staff member.
It is not just about how many tests.
The World Health Organisation advises that testing, contact tracing and isolation is critical to breaking the chains of infection and controlling the epidemic.
Unfortunately, in February, that just was not in place and we ended up with the lockdown as an emergency measure because we could not identify who we should isolate.
Understanding easing the lockdown involves difficult decisions, but we need to be aware that the virus has not changed.
We hear all the time about the mystical R number guiding the way out of lockdown, but it is an estimate of how many people are infected by each person with the virus.
It has three components: the ease of transmission from one person to another; how long a person is infectious; and how many contacts they have during that time.
Ease of transmission is a balance between the infectiousness of the virus and the susceptibility of the population.
Covid-19 is very infectious and, as a new virus, the population had no immunity.
We can reduce transmission through the personal hygiene measures—I would just emphasise that that should include not shaking hands—but 50% of the spread is asymptomatic and that is the reason to advise the use of face coverings to reduce droplet spread from people without symptoms.
The way to decrease susceptibility is with a vaccine, but that will take time.
In early March, the Government seemed to get side-tracked over the idea of herd immunity.
I was chair of the all-party group on vaccinations for all and I totally understand the aim of herd immunity, but it is usually achieved with an effective and safe vaccine, not by letting a dangerous disease just rip through the population, especially when we have no proof of how long any covid immunity would last.
The duration of infectiousness is about five to seven days and we cannot change that, but one of the problems is that covid patients seem to become infectious about two days before symptoms.
Finally, there is the number of contacts.
That is the key thing we can manipulate in one of two ways: either by isolating everyone in a lockdown, which is a blunderbuss approach because we could not identify who we should be isolating; or by isolating just cases and their contacts, so they have no contact with others.
That requires strong public health teams to provide testing, tracing and isolation of every single case to control the spread.
That should be put in place during lockdown, while people have relatively few contacts, and before lifting restrictions.
The Prime Minister set out a roadmap last night for easing lockdown in England if five tests are met.
No. 3 is a sustained fall in new cases, but the UK is still hovering over 4,000 new cases a day, and that is just the ones that are proven by a test.
No. 4 is the secure provision of testing and PPE, and neither of those criteria has been met.
Telling people to go out to work is not a baby step, especially without clear workplace and transport safety measures—we only have to look at photographs of London transport this morning to see that.
If the Prime Minister had wanted more people to leave home, I gently suggest that a “Stay apart” message might have been a bit more helpful.
Crucially, local public health teams must be in place to monitor the impact of any changes so that they can spot early warning signs of a local outbreak and take action, and that is not the case.
None of the devolved nations is ready to come out of lockdown.
In Scotland, the number of cases is falling, but we do not consider it low enough to be sure that there is no risk of a rise in infections.
I know that the political decisions on the next steps are difficult, and I do not underestimate the mental, social and economic impact of lockdown or the misery it is causing.
However, a second surge of covid cases would lead to many more deaths and put us right back to square one.",10123

They are the best of us, and I hope that we will repay their courage and dedication to our country.
I have heard from parents and schools that they have experienced issues with the free school meal voucher scheme.
Many either have not received those vouchers or have been unable to redeem them, despite the scheme having been launched more than six weeks ago.
Edenred, the contractor, has processed just 20% of the £234 million budget of the scheme, which has only a few weeks left.
At Firth Park Academy, a secondary school in Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough, 488 students—almost 40% of all students—are eligible for the scheme.
As of last week, none of those children had received or been able to redeem their vouchers.
A primary school in my constituency has had similar issues.
It waited such a long time for the vouchers to come through and was so concerned about pupil welfare that it spent £3,000 to secure vouchers itself.
Schools have tried repeatedly to contract Edenred, with one even offering staff to help process applications.
Schools
Week reported that Edenred was aware of the vast scale of the task at hand when it tendered for the contract, making it more baffling that it was so unprepared.
Urgent intervention is needed to address this gross injustice and ensure that none of those eligible for free school meals goes hungry any longer.
I also want to highlight the challenges faced by women during and after the covid-19 outbreak.
Women make up a huge proportion of those in care and nursing roles—those at the frontline of this crisis.
We have seen that even as those women battle to provide care under the hardest circumstances, their pay is often among the lowest in society.
I have also heard from many women who work in the childcare sector.
They have become increasingly concerned about the future of their employment, particularly following the withdrawal of funding that was initially promised to childcare providers by the Government.
That not only concerns those employed in that sector but adds to the pressure on key workers, who may now fear they will be left without childcare.
Many care and childcare providers face bankruptcy as costs rise, leaving these women fearing for their own economic future.
Assurances must be given that no woman should lose her job due to the covid-19 pandemic.
The true impact of this crisis cannot be fully understood until the Government have undertaken a comprehensive gender impact assessment to ensure that women are not left behind as a result of the economic impact of the covid-19 outbreak.
My constituent, Lisa Fish, is classed as a vulnerable person.
Her family have taken all the steps to shield her from the virus.
The Prime Minister’s statement last night offered them no clarity, but it did cause them extreme distress.
It is essential that the Government make their intentions crystal clear so that the public fully understand what is expected of them and to ensure that we keep people safe.

We welcome the Government’s measures, and the announcements made in the Chamber today and by the Prime Minister last night.
It is, of course, very difficult to balance the economic needs of the country with the imperative to safeguard people’s health.
With hindsight, many people might criticise some of the things that the Government have done, but I believe that the decisions that were taken have had success in reducing the death toll and helping many businesses to survive, and we welcome many of the measures to be introduced.
I believe that dealing with the virus and how we get out of lockdown should be approached on a UK-wide basis.
Of course there are going to be different nuances and conditions in different regions of the United Kingdom.
For example, in Northern Ireland we have a different school year from other parts of the United Kingdom, so some of the education measures may well be different.
The peak of the virus is also different in different regions, so that may lead to different timings.
Nevertheless, a UK-wide approach is important.
A number of Members have already mentioned the fact that we share a common border with the Irish Republic.
Surprisingly, despite the Good Friday agreement and the emphasis that the Irish Government have placed on it, at every step of this crisis they have not consulted the Administration in Stormont.
When they had the lockdown, they did not consult.
When they relaxed some of their measures, they did not consult.
They are even taking a different approach to quarantining people who come in from outside Ireland and would eventually finish up in the United Kingdom.
I think it is important that we have a UK-wide approach.
We appreciate the co-operation that there has been on a weekly basis with the Administration in Stormont by Westminster.
Looking forward is the important thing, because many businesses are concerned about what happens when the lockdown stops and this situation finishes.
We see a number of issues.
First, there has to be no cliff edge, but a tapering of the job retention scheme, which has been so vital to ensuring that workers have some money on which they can live and that employers do not have to lay off vital workers and then have to recruit them again.
Secondly, various sectors of the economy have been hit far more than others.
Tourism in Northern Ireland is an important sector of the economy, and it will take some time for it to ramp up.
It is important that we look at sectoral support.
Thirdly, many companies have already taken on additional debt through the bounce back loans and the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme, but they are debt-heavy, and there needs to be some reconsideration of how that leverage is reduced and debt replaced with equity.
The banks have an important role to play in that, and I hope the Government will work with the banks.
It is important that we work our way out of this together.
I will finish, because I see you are rising to your feet, Madam Deputy Speaker.

Today, the Office for National Statistics revealed that the lowest paid people are disproportionately more likely to die from covid, and among them, careworkers are twice as likely to die, compared with NHS workers.
We know that there have been at least 6,600 deaths in care homes since the start of this pandemic, and it has become clear that the social care sector has been something of an afterthought in the Government’s pandemic planning.
The Prime Minister has acknowledged that there is an epidemic in care homes, and we must not forget the hundreds of thousands of people who receive care in their own homes, some of whom will have died from covid and will be lost in the community statistics.
We are talking about individuals of all ages who may be frail, have complex conditions, and significant needs.
We are talking about staff who are often forced to work on the national minimum wage, and with zero-hours contracts and only statutory sick pay.
On 11 March I asked the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care whether he would be issuing personal protective equipment to social care workers, he said“we are taking that into account”.
Staggeringly, it took until 15 April and thousands of deaths before he announced a plan to tackle coronavirus in the social care sector, including measures for getting PPE to providers.
In the meantime, councils and providers struggled every day to get hold of it.
With domiciliary care staff visiting many different households in a day, and residential care staff often working in more than one setting, that delay in getting vital equipment to the frontline has undoubtedly cost lives.
What assurances can the Minister provide that all social care providers now have access to the protective equipment they need to keep their staff and clients safe?
It is welcome that provision has been expanded to ensure that all those working and residing in care homes are able to access testing.
On 23 March, I raised in the House the dangers of discharging patients from hospitals into care homes without testing, but policy change came far too late.
The long delay in access to testing enabled the virus to enter care homes with a lethal impact, spreading like wildfire.
It has been reported that some care staff do not wish to take a test because they are concerned about the financial impact of taking time off work.
Statutory sick pay is simply not enough to survive on, and it must be addressed urgently.
We must not overlook the impact of the crisis on the wellbeing of care staff, many of whom are experiencing things they have never been trained for.
Some fear that they are being blamed for the spread of the virus, and some that they may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder at a later date.

The complications of isolation make bereavement more challenging, and I pray that all can find peace, as they work through their pain of loss.
Again and again, we are struck by the professionalism, care, compassion, courage, commitment and love of our NHS and care staff.
They have gone beyond their duty to serve us, as have so many frontline workers, ensuring that the nation is fed, supported and cared for.
I know, in York, of the sacrifices that have been made by so many and thank all workers and volunteers for each act of kindness that they have shown during this crisis.
I want to raise one issue on the behalf of those workers before moving to my main contribution.
In November 2014, following the Francis report into the serious issues uncovered at Mid Staffordshire hospital, the duty of candour was introduced.
If healthcare workers are to be safe, we need to ensure that there is a place where all can safely raise concerns, and that those concerns are responded to.
The duty should extend to all.
I know that concerns have been raised by careworkers in my constituency and yet they have not been addressed.
Access to PPE is one such example.
Employers, local resilience forums and, yes, Government need to be honest in their response to the challenges that are presented, and mitigation must be put in place to protect workers.
Last night, the nation was thrown into confusion, but I believe the Prime Minister was clear: he was shifting risk from the state to individuals and businesses.
That is unacceptable when dealing with such a dangerous virus.
Today, I want to raise two major issues missing from the Government’s strategy.
To mitigate the worst aspects of the pandemic, we need better data and we need a risk analysis.
The data is scant and the risk analysis absent.
As covid-19 will be prevalent until a vaccine is administered, the right data needs collecting now.
I have two brief examples.
We receive hospital mortality figures and, latterly, figures for care homes.
However, if we are looking into infection control, it is not the location of death that is important, but the location of infection.
How many covid-positive hospital admissions originate from care homes, how many have been infected in hospitals, and then how have many died?
Clearly, infection data, not just mortality data, must be shared.
We need data to expose where risk resides.
How do the infections and deaths of so many people align with protected characteristics and underlying health conditions?
If they do align, with which ones, and what about socioeconomic circumstances?
Data needs to be granulated, so that risk is understood and mitigated.",2901

I also thank him for taking time to speak to me and to other Opposition leaders yesterday before his speech.
I start by acknowledging just how difficult are the decisions that now fall to be taken.
We do recognise how difficult they are.
At this time, the country needs clarity and reassurance, and both are in pretty short supply.
The heart of the problem, it seems, is that the Prime Minister made a statement last night before the plan was written, or at least before it was finalised, and that has caused considerable confusion.
Yesterday afternoon, a No. 10 press release said:“Anyone who can’t work from home, for instance those in construction and manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work”.
It was understood from that that today was the start date, and that that was for construction and manufacturing.
A few hours later, the Prime Minister made his statement, and there was no express reference to timeframe.
Today, page 25 of the Command Paper states that these policy changes apply from Wednesday, and the list has been expanded from construction and manufacturing to other sectors.
Now we have a start date of Wednesday and a wider range of sectors to go back to work on Wednesday; so far, so good.
One of the key issues is whether there will be guidelines in place to ensure the safety of the workforce.
Those guidelines were being consulted on last Sunday, but they were vague and had big gaps.
Under protective equipment, it just said, “To be inserted” or, “To be added”.
The document that I have now seen says that“workplaces should follow the new ‘COVID-19 Secure’ guidelines”,which I assume are the same guidelines, as “soon as practicable”, but on page 22 the document states that they will be released later this week.
So, we know that some people are going back to work on Wednesday, but the guidelines have not been published and they will apparently be released later this week.
I ask the Prime Minister: will the safety guidelines be ready for Wednesday?
Realistically, that means tomorrow, if workplaces are to be ready for Wednesday morning.
If not, is he seriously asking people to go back to work without the guidelines?
Have the guidelines been agreed with businesses and trade unions, as was being attempted a week ago on Sunday, and do they apply only in England?
I turn to getting to work, which has been another issue of some concern.
The Prime Minister said last night that people should not rely on public transport.
The Command Paper, at page 26, says that“the Government is working with public transport providers to bring services back towards pre-COVID-19 levels as quickly as possible”—bringing services back to their old levels—and it says:“Social distancing guidance on public transport must be followed rigorously”.
That means ramping up the service, with new guidelines for social distancing, but we learn from page 26 that unfortunately those guidelines are not ready; they are coming later in the week.
Are they coming tomorrow, to be ready for Wednesday, or are they coming later in the week?
If it is the latter, people will be using public transport and operators will be required to operate to guidelines that do not yet exist.
Will that be for England only, and have those guidelines been agreed with the transport providers and the relevant trade unions?
I have one other point about work.
There is a real concern, which the Prime Minister might be able to clarify, for those who have childcare responsibilities.
With schools not going back until June—I understand the conditionality behind that—should those people go back to work on Wednesday, or not?
They are in a quandary as to what to do.
I turn to international travel.
Last night, the Prime Minister said in his speech that he proposed to impose quarantine on people coming into the country by air.
Given that 100,000 people have arrived in the UK since the start of lockdown, why is that only being introduced now?
Is it only for those arriving by air?
The Command Paper now says that it is for “all international arrivals”.
Does that mean all ports, and, again, is that for England or the UK?
The Command Paper goes on to say that these “international travel measures”—the quarantine—will not come into force on Wednesday, unlike the other policy changes,“but will be introduced as soon as possible”.
When is that going to be?
The Prime Minister said that we would be“driven by the science, the data and public health.
”
What is the scientific evidence for the public health basis behind the measures that have been announced and the “Stay Alert” message?
Finally, the Prime Minister will know that there is not consensus on messaging or policy between the UK Government and those in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
I know that is not something he wanted to see, but we are now in that position.
That raises serious concerns and a real danger of divergence.
Again, this is clear from the document that he provided to me an hour or so ago.
Page 27 says that travel to outdoor spaces is now permitted “irrespective of distance”, but that we must“respect the”—different—“rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland”.
Does that mean one could travel to the border but not, presumably, beyond it, where there are differences?
That makes enforcement extremely difficult and clarity really difficult, so what can we do—what can he do—to make sure that we exit lockdown as one United Kingdom, just as we entered it?
There are lots of questions, but so far precious few answers.
The country does need clarity on this and people need reassurance above all else.
They need it in the next 48 hours, so can the Prime Minister now please provide that clarity?",5580

.
Lives are at risk, so political judgments and verdicts on this weekend’s chaos will have to wait for another day.
I respect the right of the Prime Minister to make judgments on the basis of his scientific advice.
I hope he is right in the determinations he is making, and that, crucially, if evidence suggests an increase in the R-rate, he will be prepared to act accordingly.
We need to be guided by one clear understanding, which is that mixed messaging risks lives.
In order urgently to re-establish clarity, I wish to ask the Prime Minister five specific questions, and I genuinely urge him to provide five clear answers.
For clarity, will the Prime Minister confirm that he accepts and respects that in the devolved nations, the advice clearly remains, “Stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives”, and that it is the legal right of all the First Ministers to set their approach for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?
In terms of the new slogan, last night the Prime Minister said:“I have consulted across the political spectrum, across all four nations of the UK.
”Can the Prime Minister therefore explain why his Government did not share his new slogan with the devolved Administrations, leaving them to learn of the change in the Sunday newspapers?
Further to that, will he commit not to deploy this new slogan in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland unless the devolved Governments decide otherwise?
On quarantining following travel, when will these quarantine measures come into force, and can the Prime Minister confirm whether his own Transport Secretary has told airline industry leaders that if there are too many obstacles in implementing it, it may not even happen?
Finally, for ultimate clarity, will the Prime Minister reaffirm for the public and businesses in Scotland that the advice that they should follow will come directly from the Scottish Government, and is not the advice that he gave in last night’s broadcast?",756

A number of issues arose.
On nurseries, Miss Houghton, who owns Highmeadows nursery in Bolton, has not been able to access the £10,000 rates relief because the rates on her business premises are too high, although it is in fact a small business.
Nurseries cannot access the £25,000 grant that is available for those in the retail and leisure sector.
They cannot furlough their employees, as the Government have said that as they receive state funding, they must use that money.
The Early Years Alliance says that one in four nurseries will go out of business in the foreseeable future, which is a real shame.
We rely on key workers to be able to go out to work and we need to ensure that their children are safe and being looked after.
Wales has given nurseries 100% rates relief, and I believe we should have that in England as well.
Another issue that arose was for those who rent serviced offices.
They are not able to get the rates assistance that other people that are in their own physical building can.
That is particularly unfair for small businesses and new start-ups, which often use serviced offices.
Sole-person limited companies are another issue.
Many are self-employed people who put money into their business, and pay themselves through dividends.
Under the scheme for the self-employed, the income that they receive through dividends cannot be counted so they are not able to take advantage of the security available for self-employed people.
Will the Government reconsider and allow dividends received through their companies as salary?
My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester East (Claudia Webbe) wrote to the Chancellor about the Asian wedding and hospitality industry, which is worth about £3 billion.
It has its own unique challenges, because Asian weddings tend to be very big.
To date, it seems that many of those businesses have not been able to get any assistance from the Government’s aid programmes.
I ask the Chancellor and the Prime Minister—anybody who is listening today —to please ensure that the hospitality industry is funded, and in particular the Asian wedding industry.
I have received emails from people who work as freelancers for the BBC on the pay-as-you-earn system.
They are not being furloughed and they cannot get self-employed benefits either, because they are not self-employed.
They are caught between the two.
Will the Government look at that issue again and ensure that they are properly looked after?
Recently, the Government have said that where the person who owns a premises is claiming rate relief, but the small businesses that operate within that large premises are not, local authorities should perhaps use some of their surpluses to pay and to help those people, but no guidance has been issued.
It would be great to have guidance on that as soon as possible.
Many people have fallen into a trap and are not able to be helped by the various Government schemes, so will the Chancellor or the Business Secretary join in a roundtable discussion with my constituents, in order to hear from small businesses and people who are working but who have now lost their income—",2123
2020-05-12,Covid-19,d182.3,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25293,Neil Gray,Scottish National Party,Shadow SNP Spokesperson (Work and Pensions),0,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.
I start by paying tribute to all those who are working on the frontline in the battle against this virus.
In my area of Airdrie and Shotts, they are the fantastic staff of NHS Lanarkshire, North Lanarkshire Council and other key workers who have been doing the essential work to keep us all safe and well, and also the many wonderful community groups that are doing what they can to help others.
I pass on my condolences to all those in Airdrie and Shotts who have lost friends and family to covid-19.
Some of the issues I wish to discuss today have emerged since the lockdown.
The first is the impact on people.
The UK Government schemes to support individuals, businesses and the self-employed have left millions behind.
Millions have had to apply for universal credit, with some who will be encountering the social security system for the first time and who will be facing hardship.
The self-employed scheme falls way short and needs to be looked at again.
Basing it on profit rather than turnover is a basic flaw in the experience of my constituents.
The furlough scheme needs an independent arbiter for employers unwilling to furlough.
Those who had only just started a new job before the lockdown are still being neglected; a contract of employment should have been enough to qualify.
There is also a need for the UK Government to provide certainty that they will phase the end of the furlough scheme to ensure there are no redundancies.
Where is the help for company directors who take their wages via dividends?
This is how so many small family businesses in Airdrie and Shotts derive their income, and it has gone.
The impact the lockdown is having on people’s mental health—for some because they have lost their livelihoods, others because they have lost social contact or because they already had underlying problems—needs much greater attention.
The Scottish Government have looked at this, and are increasing funding, but it is a long-term issue that is going to need greater attention.
Staying on the topic of welfare, sadly, the mixed messages of last week and the reckless unpreparedness of the Prime Minister’s announcement the other night— basically, it was to get back to work—have put at risk the relative success of the lockdown in starting to get the virus under control and therefore put lives across the UK at risk.
The lockdown has not ended, and the message is still crystal clear in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland: stay home, protect the NHS, save lives.
However, some people have already been in touch with me to ask if the Prime Minister’s statement means they can do this, that or the other.
For how many more has the Prime Minister’s easing of the lockdown and change in message meant a licence to take more risks?
The Prime Minister did all of this without consulting the devolved Governments or, apparently, the Cabinet.
This is not a time for making it up as you go along.
A crisis like this needs clear, consistent messaging and support packages that ensure that nobody faces hardship.
In another world before this lockdown, the Prime Minister promised that nobody would be punished for doing the right thing.
Tell that to the millions of people who have been forced on to universal credit or the families in Airdrie and Shotts who are part of the reported 47% increase at the Airdrie food bank.
The UK Government need to do much more listening before doing their talking, and that will be as important in the long term as it is now.
Society is going to change, and some changes are already happening.
Some are positive and others negative, but there will be opportunities to harness change to deliver a more prosperous society with greater wellbeing.
Areas such as the environment, waste and recycling, social security, employment and industry will need radical change and investment.
That is for the future, but we need to start thinking now about the good society we want to see emerge.
It cannot be what we left behind before the lockdown.
The focus right now has to be on containing and ending the health crisis, but there will be opportunities to make things better when that is resolved.
I just worry, after this last week of chaotic and irresponsible mixed messages and anonymous briefings from Downing Street, that it will take longer than it should for us to get to that point.",3409
2020-05-12,Covid-19,d184.1,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25668,Jamie Stone,Liberal Democrat,Liberal Democrat Spokesperson (Defence),0,"Greetings from the far north of Scotland.
I want to talk about tourism in the highlands.
Visitors and tourists from the UK and overseas are always very welcome in this most beautiful part of the UK, and our hospitality and tourism industry is critical to the local economy.
It is an industry that is sustainable in the long term, and which, most importantly, provides local jobs for local people.
As long as we have a high-quality tourism product, by which I mean landscape, culture, top-quality food and drink—that sort of thing—we can attract tourists to come back again and again to a truly special part of the world.
But we are in the midst of the current pandemic.
People leaving home and moving about simply increases the risk of the disease being spread.
Many in the highlands and many of my constituents are concerned that visitors will look at the map of where the virus is most common and think, “Oh well, the highlands looks pretty free.
Let’s go there.”
The trouble is that in the highlands, health services are at best limited.
The NHS staff and care workers are doing a fantastic job, but they work with limited resources and that is why we have taken the lockdown rules so seriously in the highlands.
That is why we have taken every precaution to look after one another and that is why we continue to “stay home, safe lives and save the NHS”.
The health and safety of my constituents is my greatest concern during this difficult period, so I say this to potential visitors.
In normal times you would be really, really welcome, but right now please stay in your usual homes, wherever they may be.
Please, please wait until the medical advice says that the risk of you spreading the virus to my constituents has gone.
Surely those who truly care for the highlands and highland people will respect the need to prioritise our health and safety.
Despite our strong feelings about the need to keep safe, we in the highlands also know that the longer the pandemic goes on, the more the long-term damage our local businesses will suffer.
The absence of visitors paying money to our tourism businesses possibly for weeks and months could actually cause many businesses to go under.
It is a vicious circle.
For every business that goes under during the pandemic, the highlands becomes all the poorer in what we can offer visitors when it is safe for them to return.
It is worse than that, however, because unlike many other enterprises tourism businesses are seasonal.
The money taken in during the tourism season has to be sufficient to see that businesses have enough in the bank to get through what we call the dark cold months in the highlands.
That is why I suggest that the present pandemic is so particularly dangerous for those tourism businesses.
Even if the pandemic were to end in a few months, much of the tourism season will have gone.
That is why I support the proposal from my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron) for the UK Government to introduce a 12-month financial support package to secure the survival of the tourism industry until summer 2021.
To conclude, my plea is to both the UK and the Scottish Governments.
Those tourism businesses are doing all they can just now.
For instance, selling vouchers that can be used at a later date when travel is absolutely safe is a seriously good idea, one which we should all wholeheartedly endorse and support.
But I believe that both the Scottish Government and the UK Government owe it to those tourism businesses to go a specially tailored extra mile for them right now.
Otherwise, they will go under and we will have a disaster on our hands.
I believe that all of us really owe the tourism businesses that hand of help—nothing less than that.",5344
2020-05-12,Covid-19,d186.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25689,Layla Moran,Liberal Democrat,Liberal Democrat Spokesperson (Education),0,"I start by saying an enormous thank you to everyone in my constituency.
The community spirit has been extraordinary.
We were told to socially distance, but I always thought the phrase should be “physically distance”.
In some ways, we are now closer than ever socially, and I do not want to lose that.
As we emerge, there will be elements that we do not want to lose—communities connecting more; less air pollution; the return of wildlife; the fact that every single person who is homeless has a bed for the night if they want it; more time to engage in creativity, and more time with family—but it has not been the same for everyone.
Although some call covid the great leveller, I would argue that it has been more of a common backdrop, against which the stains in our social fabric have become even more obvious.
We are all in this together, yet the lifeboats have not been evenly spread.
Someone is twice as likely to die from the virus if they live in a deprived area where housing is more overcrowded and it is harder to have any personal space.
Deprived children struggle to access education because they do not have broadband or a device, and they are falling behind.
That is secondary, of course, to whether they are eating or even safe.
People from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities go to work knowing that they are more at risk than others.
This has been a time of reflection.
As we look in the mirror, we must ask ourselves whether we are comfortable with what we see.
Do we want to go back to how it was, or do we want to negotiate a new social contract that nurtures individuals and respects nature?
The time is coming to make a decision, and I sincerely hope that we choose to seize the opportunity that we have been afforded.
Before that, however, we have the small matter of easing out of the current state of lockdown and the confusion of the Government’s most recent announcement— and it has been confusing.
My inbox was inundated last night by constituents asking questions about their jobs.
Do they have to go in or not?
Will it be safe?
And schools are much of the focus.
Given the age groups that the Government are allowing to go back—they include nursery age children, who cannot socially distance at all, but not secondary schools, where studies show that the disadvantage gap is likely to be widening—it is clear that the Government are prioritising the economy over learning.
No doubt many parents will be pleased at the prospect of some peace and quiet to enable them to get on with work, but not all.
Opinion is mixed.
After reading the Government’s guidance carefully last night, I remain very sceptical of how this will work in practice.
The economy is one thing, but what about safety?
I am especially concerned about the lack of scientific evidence presented alongside the plans to reassure us that it is safe for children to mix in this way.
Are we sure that they will not spread the disease?
How do we know?
Some heads are saying that they will not open because they do not feel that it is safe.
And what of the teachers?
Chris Whitty has said that we need a “proper debate” about teachers’ safety as schools reopen.
I believe that it is irresponsible to not have had that debate before Sunday’s announcement.
I am therefore immensely grateful to the Speaker for granting us the opportunity to question the Secretary of State for Education tomorrow in an urgent question on this matter, and I will save the rest for then.",3617

Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone), but what he said about the need for the Government to show proper respect to Parliament and to this House is correct, and I hope that it will be heard on the Treasury Bench.
I welcome the announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer of his intention to extend the furlough scheme.
For businesses in the Northern Isles that will provide welcome clarity, which is very much needed.
It will also allow us time to work out how we can build sufficient flexibility into the scheme in order to see a glide path coming out of it.
However, my welcome for the announcement is very much tempered by my regret that so much of the provision that remains for self-employed people is wholly inadequate.
We still have no answer for those small business people who rely on dividend income rather than a salary for their income.
Although it would be complicated, surely it is not beyond the wit of man if the political will were there.
The Government are allowing too many self-employed people to be left behind.
Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us.
The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.
As my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Jamie Stone) said earlier, the seasonal nature of our provision means that a support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.
Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a 12-month programme, or else the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more difficult.
We all know that at some point we will need some sort of inquiry into this.
I do not suggest that now is the moment to start that—obviously, the important thing at present is to deal with the job in hand—but we should be thinking about how the inquiry will be done.
Without prejudging the outcome, it is pretty clear that when we look back at this time, we will realise that the response to this pandemic has been at its strongest when all four Governments of the United Kingdom have been able to work together.
I commend them all for embarking on a four-nations approach right from the start, although we saw the first divergence from that this weekend, with the Prime Minister changing his messaging away from staying at home, to being alert.
That is an intrinsically problematic message.
It lacks clarity, but worse than that, it also lacks credibility with the population as a whole.
I hope that as we go ahead, the four Governments of this country will see that not as an opportunity to score points against each other, but as a warning about the need to keep a unified message.
Only with that unified message can we possibly hope to bring all four parts of this United Kingdom successfully through to the other side of this outbreak.",3019

Tragically, we know that 246 people in Salford died due to the disease in the first two months—a death rate of 95 per 100,000 of our residents.
Our thoughts are with their families, and the families of everyone who has died due to the pandemic.
At the start of this crisis the Government said that they would do whatever it takes to defeat covid-19.
Local authorities such as Salford City Council took them at their word, and have done a fantastic job in supporting vulnerable people, our care system, and local businesses.
The Government now seem to be backtracking and expecting councils to foot the bill for the crisis response.
Across Greater Manchester, Government support for local authorities is already £400 million lower than the costs our councils have incurred, with Salford Council spending £33 million extra in the first six months of the year.
Can the Minister confirm that Government Ministers meant what they said and that all additional costs incurred by councils will be covered by Government funding?
Will the Government look carefully at the suggestion from our Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham about English regional representation at Cobra meetings?
On the sustainability of local businesses, I have heard from businesses across my constituency that are not eligible for the funding support that they need—from private limited companies to veterinary businesses, from dentists through to the Veterans Garage, which operates in a shared space to provide vital support for veterans.
Given that none of the businesses that I have highlighted are eligible for any support apart from loans, what reassurances can the Minister give them about their situation?
Ministers also need to look again at the need for support for self-employed people in the creative industries.
I have been contacted by many constituents working at MediaCityUK in Salford quays, who are not eligible for support.
The Prime Minister’s announcement on Sunday, and the guidance published since, have led to confusion about what is and is not allowed.
Many of my constituents now fear that they will be forced back to work before it is safe for them.
I have heard from one constituent whose son has been told to report back for work this week, despite the fact that he lives with his mother and she has been told to shield.
The son has been on furlough but was asked to go back to work yesterday, even before the covid-19 secure guidance had been published.
Will the Minister confirm that businesses will be required to put the necessary protections in place and that no staff will be expected to go back to work until they can be sure it is safe to do so?
Will the advice on shielding cover the issue of how that can work when another family member has to go out to work, increasing the risk?
Finally, I want to talk about family support.
The Prime Minister set out a plan for getting people back to work, but the only concession for family contact was allowing one person to meet one member of another household outside, while maintaining social distancing.
I was contacted after the Prime Minister’s speech by a new mother who had given birth to her baby during lockdown.
None of her family or friends has been able to meet her baby or support her, and she is now feeling exceptionally isolated.
My constituents are being directed back to work, where social distancing is advised but is not even guaranteed.
Why is it acceptable for someone to meet large numbers of people at work, but not get the support they need with a new baby from family members?
Can the Minister clarify when we will see updated guidance for that new mother and when she will be allowed to meet family members to get the support that she needs with her baby?",2071

Can I also, given the day that’s in it and the statement from the Chancellor, recognise the importance of extending the job retention scheme?
My colleagues and I, particularly those with airports in our constituencies, have been concerned about the cliff edge proposed for the end of June.
Belfast City airport is in my constituency, Madam Deputy Speaker, and you will recall that a fortnight before this pandemic really took hold Flybe went into administration, representing 80% of all the passengers who travel through our local airport and 67% of all routes.
As we approach the end of the job retention scheme and that cliff edge in June, there is huge concern, even though it has been extended, that the aviation and tourism sectors will struggle to recover from this pandemic.
Although the extension is welcome, I hope that there will be further and sustained engagement not only for tourism and aviation but for all the associated sectors in the aerospace industry.
I am particularly concerned, even though there has been an extension of four months today, that we have yet to hear from British Airways that it is prepared to delay its redundancy plans, for example.
The plan is not only to make 12,500 employees redundant, irrespective of Government support, but to cruelly assault the terms and conditions of those workers who will be retained after the pandemic.
That is totally wrong.
I want to make mention of the self-employed income support scheme and highlight my concern that those who have accessed the portal thus far have found that their Northern Ireland driving licence is not sufficient to satisfy the ID requirements.
Nor is an Irish passport, even though many residents of Northern Ireland are perfectly entitled to hold one under the terms of the Good Friday/Belfast agreement.
I hope that that will be challenged and changed by HMRC in the days to come.
May I raise my concern about health sector capacity?
It has been noted that in Northern Ireland there has been a 40% increase in non-covid-19-related deaths compared with this time last year.
It is important that we have capacity within our health service, but it cannot be at the cost of healthcare in other sectors or for other individuals.
There are huge strides being made not only to protect our community but to do what is best for it in the light of the pressures we face.
The resolve needs to continue, and I know that the Government will work with all the devolved Administrations in ensuring we fight the pandemic and that we, as a country, succeed.",2246
2020-05-12,Covid-19,d194.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25278,Owen Thompson,Scottish National Party,SNP Whip,0,"I begin with an observation: there had been a consistent approach across the four nations, but, at a time when clarity is critical, we find ourselves in a situation where three of the four nations of the UK are still trying to be clear, consistent and cautious in their approach to tackling and beating the coronavirus pandemic; it is a great pity that the Prime Minister muddied the waters so badly over the weekend.
While it is absolutely the Prime Minister’s right to change from a very clear “Stay at home” message to the imprecise “Stay alert” message for England, it is irresponsible to spread the change in the media as if it applied collectively across the entire UK without even consulting the Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish Governments.
This is a public health matter that is rightly being considered by the devolved Administrations on the basis of scientific evidence.
It seems that the UK Government’s idea of a four nations approach is less about working respectfully together and more about, “Do as we say.”
I also for the most part welcome the Treasury’s response to this pandemic, although there are many areas that still need to be addressed.
I welcome the business support that has been put in place by the Chancellor and his efforts so far to resolve problems that have emerged with the schemes,
but a lot more urgently needs to be done to help those still left behind.
I have many constituents who have yet to receive any support and who had a viable business but cannot get a loan to see them through.
The business interruption loan scheme is too cumbersome, and too many banks are still failing to lend.
While the bounce-back scheme tackles some of those issues for smaller businesses, the reports that I have heard suggest that it remains far from a streamlined process, and there are only five accredited lenders compared with 50 for the interruption loan scheme.
There is also still the issue of support for the self-employed, particularly those who left a good job to run their own business.
I welcome the extension of the furlough scheme announced by the Chancellor earlier today and the suggested flexibility.
I welcome the extension of the furlough scheme announced by the Chancellor earlier today and the suggested flexibility.
I am keen to see the detail of that much more clearly.
As we move forward, we need to ensure that protection remains in place for those who need it.
At the end of the day, I argue that the best and most flexible support that could be put in place would be for the Government to introduce a universal basic income and genuinely ensure that nobody is missed through these tough times.
Protecting people’s lives while they are protecting their livelihoods is a complex matter.
One size does not fit all and a degree of flexibility to suit differing circumstances is needed from Government—flexible support and flexibility over strategy in the different parts of these isles.
I welcome the more cautious approach from the Scottish Government in easing lockdown.
I advise the UK Government to take a similar approach.
I appreciate that they would choose not to, but they must respect the devolved settlement and not undermine the clarity of message we have here in Scotland.",2286

I also pass on my condolences to those in East Renfrewshire who have lost loved ones.
For the UK Government to be described as “reckless” by the British Safety Council in the midst of a pandemic should make even this Prime Minister pause.
It was a disappointment that he did not share his planning or consult—not just with the devolved Administrations, but with local authorities, trade unions, employer representatives, and even, reportedly, his own Cabinet.
Having set his announcement for Sunday to allow people to get going with the measures on Monday, it emerged that no preparation had been done with regard to transport, childcare and many other issues.
Confusion reigned, even among the Ministers set out to do the morning media rounds.
Most announcements applied only to England—although you would struggle to tell—but many in the Prime Minister’s party are demanding that all four nations march towards the cliff edge in lockstep.
The response from Scotland is firm: no chance.
Is it really time to stop protecting the NHS?
If not, why is that disappearing from the heart of the campaign in England?
And why was the “Stay Alert” slogan launched with green imagery?
It is not difficult to see the signal that that is designed to send.
As the Prime Minister prevaricates and blusters, it is clear that he is trying to nudge the population into an ill-considered move.
Telling people to deal with the pandemic by staying alert is an abrogation of responsibility.
A crisis of this magnitude demands leadership; thank goodness for Nicola Sturgeon and her fellow First Ministers.
But there is no going back to the same old, same old—even if we wanted to.
The Prime Minister’s enthusiastic but vague encouragement for people in England to hop in their cars and get back to work is neither sensible nor realistic.
It displays a lack of connection to the reality of people’s lives, never mind their working lives.
The Prime Minister needs to remedy that as a matter of urgency if he has any interest in workers’ safety and wellbeing.
I applaud the UK Government for bringing in the furlough scheme but, as ever, the devil is in the less publicised detail.
T
.
There will be disquiet at the impact on jobs of the employer contribution that the Chancellor announced today that he is looking for.
I and other colleagues have been calling for flexibility in furloughing, and the Chancellor said today that there can be flexibility from August; we need to see partial furloughing before that.
The Scottish Chamber of Commerce asks that flexibility takes account of a company’s ability to contribute, which will differ depending on location and sector.
I hope that the Chancellor will take that on board.
Despite the recognition of the vulnerability of pregnant women at the start of this crisis, it took until yesterday for half a sentence of guidance to be produced.
Women have had to take sick leave or annual leave because the UK Government failed to listen when the issue was highlighted to them.
If we are to achieve an orderly end to lockdown when the time is right, listening will be vital, and fair, safe, flexible work will be key.
The Government should focus on not only sustaining jobs but enhancing fairness and employment rights as we look ahead.
They must properly examine how a universal basic income could underpin a sustainable and fair recovery, which will be so important in the months and years ahead.",3148
2020-05-12,Covid-19,d199.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25861,Steven Bonnar,Scottish National Party,Shadow SNP Spokesperson (DEFRA Team Member),0,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to take part in this general debate on covid-19 and to be a voice for the people of Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill in these unprecedented times.
This pandemic has presented completely new challenges for us all, demanding responses that have no precedent, but this is by no means an excuse for the response of this UK Government.
This is not the first time that these nations have been faced with a crisis.
Indeed, just last week, images of world war two were again broadcast into our homes.
It was a time when our nations fought bravely together and when strong leadership provided the ultimate protection against our enemy threats.
Today, we face a new fight and a new enemy, but there is no protection in the leadership of this Prime Minister.
Where we looked for leadership, calmness, and direction, we found stand-ins, mixed messages and confusion.
Covid-19 is no more a natural disaster than a famine; both are highly politicised events.
We can waste time blaming the outbreak of disease on global agribusiness, but it would be an insult to the intelligence of the people of these nations if we do not recognise that the true failure in preparation lies at the very heart of the UK Government.
For years, this Government have tried to fool us into thinking that their austerity-driven attack on our vital public services has been a societal necessity.
Yet the current crisis has magnified the absurdities of these complacent assumptions.
Will they now admit that austerity has always been an entirely political decision from which we are all now suffering: hence, the failure to implement immediate isolation and contact tracing for all those entering our borders; hence, the fatal delay in implementing lockdown; hence, the vast shortages of PPE in our hospitals and care homes; hence, the failure to meet revised testing target after revised testing target; and hence, the thousands upon thousands of lonely, untimely deaths that could and should have been prevented.
Despite those vast failings, a vague optimism has been added to proceedings: a vague optimism that people can go back to work but only if their work is open; a vague optimism that we can travel as far as we desire for exercise, but as long as public transport is not involved; and a vague optimism that we can meet with another outwith our household, but only if we do not plan to meet up with them beforehand.
This vague optimism has become the epitome of the UK Government’s message.
It is a strange pretence that everything is suddenly normalised: that witnessing the news of hundreds of deaths on our TV screens every evening is just to be accepted and that we can continue with life as we did in the past.
A de facto muddling-through has emerged in this UK Government, one that is concentrating on maximising market power rather than on prioritising public health.
It is quite disgraceful.
My constituents, like many others up and down these countries, are bearing the brunt of this confusion.
No one should be forced to risk their health or the health of their loved ones in order to maintain their employment, and yet that is the very dilemma that my constituents are facing after this Prime Minister, on Sunday night, chose, as he always does, to prioritise one-nation Conservatism over a four-nation approach.
Let me finish by saying this, Madam Deputy Speaker: our death toll is nothing short of catastrophic.
Our daily counts have far surpassed that of our neighbouring countries and somehow there is a determination to cloak this in the illusion of a Great Britain; a mythology built on inflated pride and lowered expectations.
It is not this Government who are great—far from it—but the people of these nations who make it so.
It is the health and social care workers, our security officers, our emergency responders, our till operators, our delivery drivers, and our teachers.
It is to them that I give my thanks and appreciation.
Those people are the backbone of our society and only when this UK Government begin to prioritise human life over economic prosperity will this country have something to be optimistic about.",4667

Although the past few months have been tough and we have come through much, the people of this city and my constituency know that it will take every ounce of our energy to preserve what it is that makes Edinburgh such a wonderful place.
Traffic at our airport is now almost negligible, the Royal Highland Show, which contributes £65 million to our economy, has been cancelled, and that shining gem in Scotland’s cultural calendar, the Edinburgh Festival, will not bring the world to our city this August.
Across Edinburgh, myriad small, medium-sized and international companies are concerned for their future—a future of challenges for which they are not responsible.
For us here in Edinburgh West, as in most constituencies up and down the country, perhaps the biggest task is looking after the thousands of people concerned about their health, their jobs and their financial future.
We calculated yesterday that during this period of lockdown we have dealt with around 1,000 pieces of individual casework, every one a personal emergency.
Much of this crisis has been managed by the UK Government, but also directly, here in Edinburgh, by the Scottish Government.
The issues that they face are exactly the same; but in tackling them I would appeal to both our Governments to work together.
Much has been said this week about mixed messages, uncertainty, a lack of clarity about what the UK Government were saying about lifting lockdown.
Imagine what that is like for the people of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, with advice that is often contradictory—not just different: completely contradictory.
Can I go out?
Can I go to work?
Which Government do I listen to?
Which advice do I follow?
Which guidelines are appropriate if I am out walking my dog?
That is ridiculous.
It is also not good enough for my constituents, or for any other constituent in any other part of the devolved nations.
And for those organisations and companies that I mentioned earlier, any uncertainty is a potential recipe for disaster.
In Scotland, our businesses have now had more than eight years of debate about our future.
Will our economy be in an independent Scotland?
Will our economy be in the UK?
Will we be part of the European Union or not?
All the uncertainty they have had to deal with seems small now in comparison to the emergency that is Covid-19.
I would ask both our Governments to work together, so that our airports and our airlines, which are so vital to our economy, are able to build a strategy in which they know that they will be speaking to not just the devolved authority but the UK authority and wider authorities, so that companies like Diageo, based here in Edinburgh West, know which framework they are falling into, and the people of Edinburgh West, Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom have a clear path- way out of this crisis—a clear, united pathway, with their Governments walking in lockstep for everyone’s future.",4657

Like every other MP, I want to pay tribute to my community in Richmond Park and the way that they have stepped up to the challenge of coronavirus.
On International Nurses Day, I want to talk in particular about the nurses at Kingston Hospital and those nurses and midwives who are taking time out from their training at the hospital to serve on the frontline.
We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for everything that you are doing.
I also want to take this opportunity to highlight our transport sector and, in particular, the extraordinary contribution that our transport workers have made throughout this crisis.
They have kept our buses and trains moving to get our frontline workers to their places of work, and they have had to face the same dangers.
I pay tribute to the 29 Transport for London workers who have died during this crisis, including 23 bus drivers, and I know that the whole House will join me in paying tribute to Belly Mujinga, a ticket checker at Victoria station who died after contracting coronavirus from a traveller who spat at her.
We are asking a huge amount of our transport workers.
We are now asking them to keep us safe as we return to work.
We can all appreciate how enormously difficult it will be to maintain social distancing on public transport, and I acknowledge the efforts of all those who will be charged with keeping us safe.
With the support of MPs from across the House, I wrote to both the Secretary of State for Transport and the Mayor of London last week to call for PPE for transport workers to protect them as they go about their essential work.
When we think of the families of those who have already died, we know that this is the very least we can do.
The Government need to think now about the future of our transport network.
We have the opportunity that we have been waiting for to drive through real change to achieve a greener transport network and to meet the challenge of climate change.
The massive drop of cars on our roads has led to massively increased air quality, and I know that this is a benefit that my constituents and those elsewhere will want to maintain.
It was extremely encouraging to hear from the Secretary of State for Transport about his support and game-changing investment in cycling and walking solutions, not just for our cities, but for communities elsewhere.
It is beyond time that the Government threw their support behind active travel for all the environmental, financial, mental, social and physical benefits that it offers to every traveller.
It will be not just a crucial part of getting people back to work, but part of a long-term solution for our cities and towns as we adjust to the challenge of the climate emergency, because as long as we understand that we need to avoid public transport, our bus and train companies will continue to see a catastrophic loss of revenue.
The Government need to start thinking now about how public transport networks can be maintained so that they are ready to support our workforce as they make a full return to work, as we all hope one day to do.
We also need to think long term about essential economic infrastructure and how we move freight around our country and internationally.
Hauliers and the aviation industry are also facing disaster.
They make an essential contribution to our critical supply lines, such as food and medicine, and we need to think long term about how we support those supply lines.
I have been calling on the Government to address this; if they feel that it is necessary to support those industries with a Government bail-out, this is the opportunity we have been waiting for to force the pace on meeting the challenge of climate change and to ask those industries to really start embedding greener forms of fuel and movement into their industries.",3486

The covid pandemic has forced us all to change our lives in ways we would not have imagined only a few months ago.
In all of the hardship and tragedy of this time, one of the brightest points has been the improvement in our air quality, because many fewer cars are on the road.
As we have adjusted to lockdown, many people have commented that they have thought about the benefits of talking a walk or going for a bike ride, because it is much more relaxing and there is more time to reflect.
Walking and cycling contribute greatly to our wellbeing.
We have talked at length about social distancing measures and the space we need to give each other when we are socially distancing.
In this country, safety has always been a barrier to cycling, but now, as our towns and cities are less congested, cycling has become a much safer option.
Of course, we want to restart the economy as soon as it is safe to do so, but when we do we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to look at our streets with fresh eyes.
We need to think about what did and did not work before lockdown, and at what we want to achieve as we put in place the conditions for a new normal.
For decades we have been overdependent on cars, and that must change.
I have also spoken before about the need to tackle emissions from surface transport.
We have been having these discussions in my city of Bath, which has suffered from severe air pollution, for many months now.
As we slowly emerge from lockdown, we need to look at ways to avoid a dramatic resurgence in car use, particularly as many people may be nervous about using public transport.
Other countries are already looking at ways to rebalance the priority given to cars over cyclists and pedestrians in urban areas, through segregated cycle lanes, speed reduction zones or new and widened pavements.
I welcome the Transport Secretary’s new guidance to local authorities.
Early action will be crucial, in order to embed changes in behaviour

2020-05-12,Covid-19,d208.1,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25120,Jon Ashworth,Labour,Shadow Secretary of State for Health,0,"I am grateful to you for that, Madam Deputy Speaker.
We have heard many fine speeches over two days, and I hope Members will forgive me for not being able to mention them all.
Throughout this outbreak, our paramount concern has been to save lives and minimise harm.
That means suppressing the virus, not managing its spread.
We are tracking towards one of the worst death tallies in the world, with more than 40,000 deaths, every one a tragedy, and this House cannot ignore the disproportionate impact the virus is having on black, Asian and minority ethnic communities—a thorough inquiry is a necessity.
Today’s debate is not an inquest.
No doubt there will have to be, in the future, a full and proper public inquiry, with access to an abundance of material and data.
However, the Government must understand the concern, grief and anguish of our constituents who have lost loved ones or suffered great harm.
Ministers should expect searching questions.
For example, did we enter lockdown too late?
Ministers tell us they were following the science, but a SAGE paper from February on social distancing concedes:
“It is a political decision to consider whether it is preferable to enact stricter measures at first…or to start with fewer measures”.
As the Chair of the Health Committee, the right hon. Member for South West Surrey (Jeremy Hunt), said yesterday,“Ministers have to take responsibility for their decisions.”—[Official Report, 11 May 2020; Vol. 676, c. 59.]
This virus exploits ambivalence.
It demands clear public health messaging.
Points about confused messaging have been made eloquently throughout the debate, but fundamentally the point is that nobody should be asked to go to work or send their children to school without it being safe to do so, and many do not believe that the Prime Minister’s instructions on Sunday evening yet meet that test.
The Government must work with the TUC to ensure that strict safety measures are in place.
No worker should be forced to put their health at risk.
I hope the Minister can tell the House what the impact of asking people to go back to work will be on the R0.
The lockdown has been a powerful tool to bring down transmission, and easing lockdown too soon risks a dangerous second wave, with unacceptable further loss of life, so we support its continuation.
But lockdown has a cost.
It has an economic cost, certainly.
It has a detrimental cost for children who spend months out of school; UNICEF has warned that children are not the face of this pandemic but risk being among its biggest victims.
It also has a cost for health.
We talk about protecting the NHS, but the extra surge capacity in the NHS has been built on the back of 2 million operations cancelled, cancer treatment delayed, unquantifiable mental health problems left to fester, and falling A&E attendance.
There will indeed be long-term mortality and morbidity as a consequence of this lockdown.
Ministers need to fund the NHS for that growing burden of unmet clinical need.
However, we cannot leave the lockdown safely unless thorough public health measures are in place.
We need case finding, testing, tracing and isolation, which have been vital to the success of nations such as South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.
Testing and surveillance are crucial to properly understanding prevalence and the estimates of the R0.
The former Business Secretary, the right hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark), put it well yesterday when he said:I agree.
We were doing tracing in February, and then we abandoned it on 12 March.
It took until 29 April for adverts to start appearing to recruit tracing call centre staff, a service that is to be handed over to the private sector.
I do not believe that that tracing should be done by Serco.
Instead, we must use the expertise in local public health services, our environmental health officers and our strength in primary care, and GPs should routinely be sent the test results of their patients.
Given the levels of significant asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, we need a proper targeted testing strategy too.
All healthcare workers must be screened regularly.
A study by Imperial suggested that that would reduce transmission in healthcare settings by up to a third.
Because Office for National Statistics data show higher mortality in more deprived areas, with those in lower-paid occupations at greater risk, inequalities in accessing testing must be stamped out, and people must be provided with the means to self-isolate.
That should include making use of hotel rooms and providing decent, more generous statutory sick pay if people cannot isolate at home.
We need to take other public health measures too.
We support the quarantining of arrivals for 14 days at airports, but why did the Government not implement that earlier, and why is there still a lag in enforcing it?
I am sure I am not the only Member struck by the curious irony that a party that promised to take back control of borders has conspicuously failed hitherto to enforce any border restrictions at a time of a devastating global pandemic.
We need to minimise outbreaks in vulnerable settings.
Exercise Cygnus warned about the risks in care homes.
The Government document published yesterday proclaimed that“the Government will continue to bolster the UK’s social care sector”.
Today we learned of 8,312 tragic deaths in care homes.
Why did Government official guidance until 12 March say:
“It remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected”?",5322

Given that the Prime Minister previously attacked what he called the “health and safety fetish” as “madness”, and in 2009 said public warnings were “for the extremely stupid”, the fact that this Government are stressing the need for health and safety must be welcomed.
However, it is important to give the utmost clarity.
I know that is what the Secretary of State will like to think he has done, but his advice is addressed to UK employers.
Will he acknowledge, in the spirit of clarity, that his advice is for England only?
The advice in the other nations of the UK remains to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.
Lives are at stake.
We must have complete clarity.
Shops in Scotland are not scheduled for phased reopening from 1 June.
Will he make that clear?
His five-point plan does not apply at this time in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
Will he make that clear?
We welcome the measures announced today to transition the furlough scheme, because business and people would be harmed by a cold restart without protection.
However, before any reductions in furlough or rates of support start, we first need to fill the gaps for those left behind: those who had a contract or letter of employment by 29 March but whose employers have not logged into Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, those agency workers who are not included, staff whose pay is combined with commission, and the forgotten but vital summer seasonal workers.
Will the Secretary of State make the case for those workers, or are they still to be left behind?
Finally, the Secretary of State has made great play—I quote from his statement—of“Building a consensus and confidence when moving forward”.
Will he take that message back to the Cabinet and the Prime Minister, and extend it to the leaders of the devolved nations?

I would also like to wish the Chancellor many happy returns.
As a constructive Opposition, we want to work with the Government to ensure that people’s jobs and incomes are protected and the furlough scheme is a critical element of that.
Many of the more than 6 million people who are currently furloughed were taken aback by comments made in the media by Government spokespeople suggesting that, for example, people needed to be weaned off an addiction to the scheme.
There were many intimations that changes might have been announced to that scheme by the Chancellor, potentially in the media, without the opportunity for proper scrutiny.
I have only heard about these changes in the last few seconds.
We will look at them very carefully, but there are some critical principles that the Chancellor surely must follow as he redesigns the scheme.
First, we must acknowledge that people did not want to be furloughed.
It occurred through no choice of their own and through following the Government’s advice about the closure of sectors.
It is critically important that they are not penalised for that choice.
I welcome the flexibility mentioned.
We have asked for that repeatedly; it applies in many other countries.
It has been a long time coming, but I welcome the fact that it is occurring now.
That flexibility includes an employer contribution, so the Chancellor needs to provide more information about that employer contribution now.
He also surely needs to provide more information about alternatives to the scheme.
Other countries have job creation, training schemes and redeployment schemes.
We do not have those yet.
Will the Chancellor work with me, trade unions, businesses, local authorities and further and higher education institutions to create the support that is so desperately needed?",873

The coronavirus job retention scheme has kept people from unemployment at a cost to other parts of the UK Government’s spending and to the economy as a whole.
I welcome his commitment to extend it to October and to look at flexibility in the scheme, because that is something that many, including the Scottish National party, have been calling for.
.
We await the details of that, which I hope we will see before too long.
Does he recognise that removing or reducing wage support levels in the furlough scheme prematurely would increase universal credit claims, force workers back to work before it is safe for them, and risk a second peak?
The Scottish Government have been clear that the stay-at-home advice has not changed, so will the Chancellor commit today to ensuring that the job retention scheme will remain in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland if our lockdowns continue longer than in England?
Lastly, will he commit to looking at the gaps within the scheme for new starters, and will he look at those businesses who are still waiting for money under the scheme, because he said that he would do whatever it takes, and if he does not fill those gaps, that will ring very hollow?",959

2020-05-12,Covid-19: Transport,d165.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25475,Jim McMahon,Labour,"Shadow Minister (Housing, Communities and Local Government) (Devolution)",0,"I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of the statement.
I also thank him for the way in which he has maintained communication and shown a willingness to work together in the national interest.
I know that everyone in this House and at home will join me in sending our thanks to all transport workers across the country.
As with all our frontline workers, they are the very best of us.
It is so important that we give a voice to those workers.
Even today, the official advice is found wanting and it will lead to confusion.
The scenes we saw yesterday on public transport were unsurprising when the Government ordered a return to work with 12 hours’ notice but without the guidance being in place on how people can be kept safe.
May I therefore ask the Secretary of State why his announcement was not made before the Prime Minister’s statement on Sunday?
Secondly, the Government have produced guidance for bus passengers and operators, but it leaves too much to chance and fails to protect frontline workers.
It risks a postcode lottery on standards and protection, and there is far too much “should”, “could”, “not always possible” and “as much as you can”, rather than clear, directive guidance.
For bus drivers, for instance, the guidance is that PPE should not be used, but instead reserved for health and care staff.
That is despite shocking figures released by the Office for National Statistics that show professional drivers, including those operating taxis, private hire vehicles, buses and goods vehicles, have some of the highest covid-19 fatality rates in the country.
May I therefore ask the Secretary of State for the evidence base to support the position that the provision of PPE should not be provided for frontline staff on transport?
What discussions have taken place to ensure co-operation across our devolved nations to offer clear and consistent standards for transport, such as buses and rail that, of course, crosses from nation to nation?
When the Secretary of State says he announced last week a £2 billion fund for cycling, it sounded awfully familiar.
Will he confirm that that actually is not new money, but was instead announced pre-lockdown back in February?
In that context, can he confirm whether it has now been paid to local councils?
The Secretary of State touched on the aviation sector in the guidance that has been produced.
A number of airlines have already announced a significant number of redundancies, affecting tens of thousands of jobs directly and throughout the supply chain.
Even as we transition to a green economy, protecting jobs now so that people can be reskilled for the future is critical.
It will be far easier to transition from a point of strength rather than of weakness.
The Government have failed to offer a sectoral deal for aviation.
There is a real chance to set conditions on staff wages, payments to UK-based suppliers, a shift to green technology, demand that those who seek our help pay fairly into the tax system, as well as halt the payment of shareholder dividends.
Why have the Government failed to act?
Aviation is not alone.
We have seen this with ferry operators and the announcement of more than 1,100 jobs at risk with P&O.
The Prime Minister’s 14-day quarantine proposal is a total mess.
It states that everyone must be quarantined, unless they come from anywhere in the world via France, which is one of the worst affected countries in Europe after the UK.
Will the Government produce the scientific advice that justifies why France should be exempt from that policy?
Why have the Government decided that now is the time to implement this measure, two months after other countries introduced it?
More than 18 million passengers have entered the UK since January.
Will the Government publish the scientific advice that led to that change now and not earlier?
Finally, we urgently need a comprehensive plan for transport.
The public rightly demand an end to the chaos surrounding the exit plan.
The risk is not just that more lives will be lost needlessly, but that the economic damage will be far deeper, hurting our communities for a generation to come.
The Opposition will continue to work together in the national interest, but the Secretary of State must take a message back to the Cabinet table: no more confusion, no more reckless briefings, and no more delay.
This is a national crisis that needs a Government who are fit to respond to it, and we hope for the country that that comes sooner, rather than later.",4229
2020-05-12,Covid-19: Transport,d168.3,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25291,Gavin Newlands,Scottish National Party,Shadow SNP Spokesperson (Transport),0,"Although many businesses across the transport industry are fighting for survival, I note that this is the first time since this situation began that we have seen a Transport Minister in the Chamber delivering a statement or responding to an urgent question.
With that said, I welcome the accelerated investment in active travel schemes, which follows a similar announcement by the Scottish Government back in April.
The guidance for England highlights the serious challenges that operators will face in the implementation of the guidance for the foreseeable future and the real and understandable anxiety facing the travelling public.
In the section that deals with vulnerable workers—those with medical conditions for whom coronavirus is a serious risk—it says that employers “should offer support”,“should consider the level of risk”and should consider“the guidance on clinically extremely vulnerable”people and so on.
The word “must” does not appear once.
Does the Secretary of State not agree that the language is too weak and needs to be strengthened, lest some clinically vulnerable workers be put at risk?
The running of regular services with capacity cut by up to 90% is unsustainable without Government support.
Has the Secretary of State estimated how much the implementation will cost and when his Department will start to fund the support required by operators and local government?
Given that I am still waiting on a response to any of the letters that I have emailed to the Secretary of State, dating back to the start of April, on the support—or rather, the lack of it—offered to sectors such as road haulage, coaching, roadside recovery, holiday travel and aviation, when does he plan to make a statement covering those issues?
In Scotland, aviation businesses such as airports, Loganair and baggage handlers are exempt from business rates for a year, but people are losing their jobs right now, with businesses folding or being forced to restructure and downsize, and some, such as IAG British Airways, sadly seeing an opportunity to force through changes to workforce terms and conditions that they had been trying to implement for a decade.
The extension of the furlough scheme is welcome, but with social distancing likely to be with us for some time, the aviation sector requires more support; when will the Secretary of State introduce such measures?",1107

The Government said that they would do “whatever it takes” to get the country through the covid crisis and protect the most vulnerable.
The Opposition want the Government to succeed.
Lives, livelihoods and homes are on the line.
In a spirit of constructive co-operation, we have scrutinised plans carefully and offered suggestions and challenges when appropriate, to try to help to bring down infections and the numbers of people who are infected or who are tragically dying, and to help people manage financially.
Sometimes the Government have heeded our calls, sometimes not.
I would like them to consider these.
Today’s announcement provides welcome news for some—and of course we all want new homes to be built —but it leaves more unanswered housing questions, which urgently need Government attention to keep people safe at work and at home, as we do not have community testing, a cure or a vaccine and there are still problems with personal protective equipment.
What protection will there be for people who rent, if a landlord or an estate agent wants to show a prospective buyer or new tenant around?
What will the Government do to help those trapped by the cladding and leasehold scandals at this time?
What discussions have the Government had with the trade unions?
There was no mention of that in the statement.
What advice do the Government have for anyone who feels that their workplace or construction site is not safe?
This crisis has taught us that if anyone is struggling, we are all affected.
The announcement focused on those who want to move home, but it ignored those who are at risk of being forced to do so.
The Secretary of State talked about show homes, but not about people with no home.
We have shown that when we work together we can virtually eliminate street homelessness in days.
There must be no going back, but people in emergency accommodation face that.
Will the Government work with councils and homelessness organisations on the issue of how to provide and pay for a “housing first” approach, so that we can end street homelessness for good this year?
The Secretary of State said that he knew that homes were sanctuaries, but there is no plan for what happens when the temporary ban on evictions ends.
We need to prevent people from falling into arrears, so will the Government heed Labour’s calls to fill gaps in the financial support schemes?
Will he guarantee that the local housing allowance will stay at 30% of market rent?
Will he consider raising it further until the crisis eases?
People who are struggling with their rent are worried about what will happen when the ban lifts.
The Government say that they are“working with the Master of the Rolls to widen the existing ‘pre-action protocol’ on possession proceedings for Social Landlords, to include private renters and to strengthen its remit”.
That is not enough, so will the Secretary of State consider Labour’s proposal to halt section 8 evictions on the grounds of arrears caused by the lockdown?
In March, Ministers said that they would provide“whatever funding is needed for councils to get through this and come out the other side”.
That pledge has been repeated by the Secretary of State.
This week, however, he told the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee that councils should not“labour under a false impression”that all costs would be reimbursed.
Which is it?
Will the Secretary of State honour his original commitment to councils?
The Under-Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate (Luke Hall), appeared to require local authorities to provide accommodation for people with no recourse to public funds but without funding, leading to confusion and people being left out.
Will the Secretary of State ensure that there is specific funding for housing people with no recourse to public funds?
Councils cannot borrow for revenue spending or run deficits.
If they cannot balance the books they have to stop spending.
They are currently £10 billion short—a fifth of council spending.
They could close every library, leisure centre and children’s centre, turn off all the streetlights, and lock the gates to parks, and they would still be billions of pounds short.
They would have to make cuts to social care and public health at this time.
Will the Secretary of State ensure that councils are fully recompensed for housing and other costs in this crisis?
Finally, during the crisis we have all become aware of people in overcrowded, unsafe homes, who are unable to self-isolate and worried about the rent.
We know how bad it is for mental and physical health when families have no outside space.
The Secretary of State says that he wants “more homes, safer homes, and higher quality, more beautiful homes”, but he does not say how he will ensure that they are higher quality, or safe, or beautiful.
He could have decided to invest in high-quality, safe, beautiful, socially owned, zero-carbon, truly affordable housing.
That would capture the national spirit and turn it into building our future.
Instead, the Government have focused on private house sales and even today asked councils to allow developers to defer section 106, the community infra- structure levy, which is likely to reduce the numbers of new social and affordable homes.
Will the Secretary of State please work with the Treasury, housing associations, local authorities and the building industry to invest in high-quality, truly affordable social housing?
Our broken housing system has been brutally exposed.
Key workers we applaud each week live in poor housing.
They have been left behind too long.

I want to focus on the part announcing a “clear, coherent” plan.
This is an issue that many of us have found, whether with his statement or the statement before it on education.
The position in Scotland remains unchanged: people should protect the NHS, stay at home and save lives.
This Government often announce big decisions without making it clear that they do not apply to people in Scotland.
We in Scotland will take the decision about when to lift the lockdown based on science and when it is right to do so, so I would appreciate it if the UK Government would be more explicit in making it clear that this is for England only.
There are elements of this that I am puzzled by, particularly some of the restrictions that are being eased, because we are saying to people that they cannot see both their parents at the same time, but they can welcome two complete strangers into their home.
It also does not make sense that kids cannot go out and have a kickabout with their friends in the next garden, but removal men can come into the house, potentially passing on the virus.
Those are just two examples of how this does not necessarily stack up.
From a messaging point of view, we have gone from saying on Saturday, “Stay at home, protect the NHS, and save lives,” to saying four days later, “You can traipse around any random stranger’s house.”

I hope that, to allay these concerns, he can address the following issues today.
Will the Secretary of State consider changing the focus of the plan so that, instead of asking schools to scramble to implement an unrealistic plan by a specific date, we ask them to plan to meet certain conditions that, when met, would signal that it was safe to open—a subtle but important distinction?
Does he acknowledge that, due to the availability of staff and space, splitting classes while simultaneously providing remote learning is incredibly difficult, and will he work with schools to develop a realistic plan for social distancing?
Has he modelled the impact of reopening schools on the infection rates, and will he publish that?
Will he acknowledge that for younger year groups, social distancing will be virtually impossible and that the current guidance, sadly, gives the impression that those pupils and staff should just accept being exposed?
With this in mind, will he rethink the position on PPE?
Finally, most schools break up for summer in mid-July; if the ambition is to get pupils back for a month, that means the whole school would need to be back less than two weeks after the priority years, so how does the Secretary of State expect schools to implement social distancing for the whole school when many heads say this is just impossible?
If they do not, then what is the point of schools planning strict health and safety measures for two weeks only to abandon them?

As a parent of two young children, I can attest to the difficulty of explaining social distancing, let alone getting the kids to practise it, and that is why so many parents fear sending their children to school.

2020-05-18,Covid-19 Response,a380.1,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25120,Jon Ashworth,Labour,Shadow Secretary of State for Health,0,"On symptoms, the right hon. Gentleman will know that many healthcare specialists were making these warnings eight weeks ago, so can he explain why there has been a time lag in updating the case definition?
I note what the right hon. Gentleman said about social care, but he will be aware that more than 12,500 people have sadly died in care homes because of covid-19.
Last week, he said that he had put a protective ring around care homes from February, but yesterday a care home provider wrote in The Sunday Times:“Elderly people weren’t a priority”They also wrote:“The government was asleep at the wheel.
”Is the reality not that there was no early lockdown of care homes when needed, and there was no testing of people transferred from hospital to care homes until mid-April, seeding the virus?
Personal protective equipment was requisitioned from care home staff and given to the NHS because of wider shortages.
There was guidance suggesting that infection was unlikely, and that guidance was still in place when there was community transmission.
We still do not have full testing of all residents and care home staff 12 weeks later.
No wonder Age UK has said that this is “too little, too late”.
I note that the right hon. Gentleman said that testing will be expanded.
Can he bring forward the date by which all care home residents and staff will be routinely tested?
The document last week says that it will be by 6 June.
Why can the date not be sooner?
Has this crisis not shown that our care sector is staffed by exceptional, dedicated people, and that migrant care workers are not low skilled but immensely able?
Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the Home Office should acknowledge that, and praise such potential workers, not penalise them?
I welcome the wider roll-out of testing.
The right hon. Gentleman did not mention the antibody test.
Could he update the House on that front?
It has also been reported today that 20% of hospital patients got covid while in for another illness.
Two weeks ago, he suggested to me in the House that he planned to roll out screening of all healthcare workers, whether symptomatic or not.
Can he update us on that front?
On tracing, I have long argued that the safe way to transition out of the lockdown is by having a test, trace and isolation strategy in place, but it depends on a quick turnaround of test results.
Can the right hon. Gentleman tell us the current median time for test results to be received by someone when carried out by the Deloitte and other private sector testing facilities, and how soon do directors of public health and GPs receive those results?
The right hon. Gentleman knows that I believe he should be making better use of local public health services.
None the less, he is pressing ahead with the national call centre delivered by Serco.
Can he tell us by what date that tracing service will be operational?
Will it be operational by 1 June?
The right hon. Gentleman did not talk about isolation as one of his key elements of the test-trace strategy.
Many poorer people will not be able to self-isolate.
Will he look at providing facilities for such people, such as empty hotel rooms so they can quarantine?
Will those in insecure work be guaranteed sick pay if they are asked to isolate for seven or 14 days?
On the R number, will the right hon. Gentleman guarantee that every easing of restriction, such as asking children to return to school, is accompanied by a Government statement on the expected impact on the R number and the underlying prevalence of infection?
If R rises to be greater than one in a region or local area, how will the Government respond?
As the right hon. Gentleman says, this is Mental Health Awareness Week.
We are very fearful of a growing burden of mental health issues, especially in children, as a result of the lockdown.
What extra investment is he putting into mental health services, particularly children’s health services?
NHS staff, who are threatened not only by exposure to the virus, but the trauma, emotional distress and burnout associated with working on the frontline, need support as well.
They need PPE, they need fair pay, they need mental health support.
Those care workers who are caring for us need us to care for them and we should thank them again in Mental Health Awareness Week.",3136

What does he believe is the cause of the non-covid excess death rate?
With respect to the PHE’s findings, which I am pleased to see published today, we have always known that there is a social gradient in health.
The poorest and most deprived have inequality in access to healthcare and inequality in health outcomes.
What the Secretary of State has confirmed today is that covid thrives on inequalities.
Yes, indeed, black lives matter, but it is surely a call to action that black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more likely to die from covid and more likely to be admitted to intensive care with covid.
He has seen the findings.
I note that the Equalities Minister is taking work forward, but what action will be taken to minimise risk for black, Asian and minority ethnic people?
There are other vulnerable groups who are highly at risk.
I am sure the Secretary of State will have seen today the Care Quality Commission report which shows a 134% increase in deaths of people with learning disabilities.
Surely it is now time to expand testing to those under 65 in receipt of adult social care.
On the easing of restrictions, the Secretary of State said that this was a sensitive moment—well, quite, Mr Speaker.
Our constituents have concerns and are looking for reassurance, particularly those in the shielding group.
They really should not have had to wake up on Sunday morning to find out that they could now leave the house once a day.
They need clarity and details.
And why were GPs not informed in advance?
We are still at around 50,000 infections a week, so may I press the Secretary of State a bit further on the easing of restrictions?
The biosecurity level remains at 4, but his own Command Paper from 11 May said that changes to lockdown“must be warranted by the current alert level”.
At the Sunday news conference, the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government said that all the proposed easing of restrictions had been modelled and showed that the R value remained below 1.
That is, of course, reassuring, but will he now publish that modelling so that it can be peer-reviewed?
The easing of restrictions was based on tests, so may I ask the Secretary of State a couple of questions?
First, on NHS capacity, we know that the NHS has not been overwhelmed, but that has been on the back of cancelled planned surgery, delays to vital treatment, and the postponing of cancer screening.
Arguably, it has been the biggest rationing exercise in the history of the NHS.
Will he now publish the total number of planned operations that have been cancelled and detail them by procedure?
As the lockdown is eased, is it his intention to step down some of that surge capacity so that this backlog of clinical need can start to be tackled?
On managing the virus, one of the tests is on whether we can manage the virus, but, as the Secretary of State has said, that depends on testing and tracing.
There is now capacity for more than 200,000 tests, but there is still a lack of clarity about how that figure is arrived at.
The UK Statistics Authority has written to him today, saying that his figures are still“far from complete and comprehensible”,that the testing statistics still fall well short of standards in the code, and that it is not surprising that testing data is mistrusted.
That is quite damning, I have to say to him.
Will he start publishing again the actual numbers of people tested?
Will he stop counting tests mailed to homes as completed?
Will he detail what proportion of the 200,000 tests are diagnostic PCR, what proportion are antibody, and what proportion are surveillance?
Can he tell us how many care home staff and residents have been tested?
When will he start weekly testing of all NHS staff, as that is crucial for getting on top of infections in hospitals?
Will he tell us what percentage of the Deloitte-run testing facilities have been sent to GPs?
On test and trace, which is absolutely vital to safe easing out of the lockdown, the Prime Minister told the House before the recess that it would be “world-beating” and operational by yesterday, but it is not actually fully operational at a local level, is it?
Can the Secretary of State confirm that local directors of public health have been told to prepare strategies for tracing with a deadline of the end of June, that they will not actually start receiving local individual data until next week, and that many have still not been told their allocations of the extra £300 million nor what they can spend it on?
When will they get those allocations?
Despite this, he said yesterday that test and trace is up and running.
I am not sure how he can say that it is up and running when local directors of public health are still asking for that information.
Will he publish the data and what percentage of infections have been contacted and how many contacts have been followed up?
Will that data be published on a daily basis?
This is a crucial week, given the easing of restrictions, and our constituents want reassurance and clarity, but I am afraid that trust has been undermined by the Dominic Cummings scandal.
Our constituents want to do the right thing for their loved ones and their neighbours.
Can he give them those reassurances today?",5885

Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Dr Whitford), who is excluded from taking part, given the removal of the hybrid Parliament—for now.
There are growing concerns that this Tory Government is taking a cavalier approach on coronavirus, by rushing to ease lockdown measures despite warnings from public health experts.
There are serious questions to answer on the political decisions the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary have taken, which could increase the rate of infection and put lives at risk—or even cause a second wave of covid-19.
The Government claim to follow the science, so why have they ignored the experts who have advised against opening schools or easing lockdown further, without pausing to evaluate each step?
On what basis were the decisions made to allow groups of people from six different houses to meet in England, to tell 2.2 million people in the shielded group that they can go outside and to send people back to work in England on 11 May without a functioning test, trace and isolate system in place?
The results from the Deloitte regional test centres are still not being reported to local public health teams.
How does the Secretary of State plan to fix this, and by when?
What financial support will be put in place for those called on to isolate as asymptomatic contacts, especially as this could happen more than once?
With test and trace depending on people being willing to isolate if told to do so by a contact tracer, does the Secretary of State not regret that he and his Cabinet colleagues have completely shredded their own lockdown rules to protect a man who thought he was above the rules?
In refusing to sack Dominic Cummings for travelling 260 miles with his wife, who was symptomatic, the Prime Minister has destroyed his own “Stay home and save lives” message.
We know that the Dominic Cummings scandal has undermined efforts to tackle the virus by eroding trust in the UK Government and its public health guidelines, and we have seen that people are breaking the rules as a result.
Does the Secretary of State not recognise that the scandal has already undermined lockdown and could lead to more infections and even more deaths in the future?

We have been calling for sensible screening measures at the border for months, and will of course study the detail of what has been announced.
It is vital that the UK has a plan for minimising the risk of infections coming into the country, but the Home Secretary must also realise that there are fundamental questions that she needs to answer: why these particular measures, and why now?
From 1 January to 23 March, when the lockdown was imposed, only 273 people were formally quarantined from four flights—three from Wuhan and one from Tokyo—when over 18 million people enter the country by air.
The Home Secretary just said in her statement that this was because domestic transmission was widespread, but the Government’s own chief scientific adviser said that“a lot of the cases in the UK didn’t come from China and didn’t come from the place you might have expected, they came from European imports and the high level of travel into the UK at that time.
”Ministers saw on their television screens what was happening in Italy and Spain.
On 30 April, I wrote to the Home Secretary to ask her to publish in full the scientific advice that her decisions on measures at the border at that time were based on so that we could learn the lessons going forward.
She has not even replied to my letter.
Not making all that information public is a mistake.
Unfortunately, like too much of the Home Office’s handling of this crisis, the management of arrivals to the United Kingdom has lacked urgency and coherence.
As long ago as 10 May, the Prime Minister gave notice of these quarantining measures.
Why have the Government wasted precious weeks talking about possible border restrictions, rather than taking effective actions?
If these measures are necessary from 8 June, why have they not been necessary in recent weeks or from when they were first announced by the Home Secretary herself —on 22 May?
Can the Home Secretary give me her assurance that the measures that will take effect from Monday next week have been recommended and approved by SAGE?
I join her in her praise of what those at Border Force have done, but can she give me further assurance that Border Force staff on the frontline will have all the resources and protection that they need?
The Government’s confusion over arrivals and quarantine has widespread implications for the UK economy, particularly aviation, hospitality and tourism, and related supply chains.
Huge numbers of jobs are at risk, yet the crucial package of support for these industries that Labour has argued for has yet to materialise.
In her statement, the Home Secretary mentioned a roundtable with the Transport Secretary and businesses tomorrow, but the Government should already have done that.
They should be presenting these steps today as part of an all-encompassing approach to travel and the aviation sector, backed up by the published scientific evidence.
This is necessary because there has to be reassurance that quarantine has a genuine public health benefit now that, according to the Government, it did not have in past months, and that these measures are not just a three-week fudge to try to spare the Government the embarrassment of failing to grip this issue at the right time.
Given that there is no vaccine at the moment and that test, track and isolate is not fully up and running as the Government promised it would be, will the Home Secretary make a commitment to report back to the House before the end of the initial three-week window on that first review that she mentioned in her statement, outlining her proposed exit strategy from these measures and her plans for any travel corridors?
Can the Home Secretary pass on the message to the Government about how urgent it is that the comprehensive package to support jobs is brought forward as soon as possible?",2903

Like her, I pay tribute to our Border Force and other key workers.
The Scottish National party has been calling on the UK Government to introduce public health measures at UK borders for some months.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford has said that the effectiveness of quarantine during a viral outbreak relies on the timing and accuracy of the quarantine period, as well as the ability of individuals and healthcare providers to follow quarantine procedures.
I fear that the Home Secretary’s statement does not fully address these matters.
There is widespread concern that the UK is out of step with most other countries, which introduced public health measures at their borders far earlier in the pandemic.
The best way for her to address the failure to introduce any measures to date, as well as the effectiveness of the measures that she proposes, is to publish the evidence and advice on which she has relied.
The matter was discussed at the meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies on 7 May, but its advice has yet to published.
Will the Home Secretary undertake to publish that advice today, and can she tell us what advice SAGE has given about the widely reported suggestions that the Government intend to water down the quarantine proposals?
Does SAGE think that the quarantine measures will be effective if the watered-down proposals are introduced?
The Home Secretary said that the measures would be considered regularly, commencing the week beginning 28 June, but can she tell us how long overall she envisages that the measures will be in place?
Finally, the measures at the border are her responsibility as Home Secretary, but part of their delivery and enforcement will be in Scotland, and will be the responsibility of the Scottish Government.

The Government are easing restrictions, but even when looking at their own tests we know that PPE supplies are still not secured—dentists are warning about PPE today; that tracing is still not fully operational—the chief operating officer of test and trace has warned that it will not be fully operational until September; that testing is still not sufficient—we are still not routinely testing all NHS staff, whether asymptomatic or not, even though we know that such testing will arrest the spread of the virus in hospitals; and that the R value, according to the PHE Cambridge model, is close to 1 in many regions and is at or above 1 in the north-west and the south-west.
The modellers of that model warn that that may result in the“the decline in the national death rate being arrested by mid-June.
”
The British people have shown great resilience and fortitude in observing this lockdown and helping to slow the spread of this deadly, horrific virus, but we have still had more than 40,000 deaths.
As the Secretary of State said, infections are still running at more than 5,000 a day.
We should proceed with caution, but many now fear that the Prime Minister is starting to throw caution to the wind.
I therefore wish to put some specific requests to the Secretary of State: will he agree to start publishing, on a weekly basis, the regional R value estimate, alongside the national estimates?
Does he agree that the voices of regions must be heard in future decisions about lockdown?
Will he start including the various metro Mayors, such as Andy Burnham, in the covid Cobra meetings?
Will the Secretary of State ensure, this week, that local authorities and general practitioners start receiving specific data about who has tested positive so that they can start putting in place area-based responses?
Will he issue, this week, written guidance on defining what a “local lockdown” is, how it will be enforced and what resources and powers local authorities and agencies will be able to draw upon?
Finally, we know that the more deprived an area is, the higher the covid mortality level.
There are pockets of deep deprivation in the north-west and in the south-west, such as in parts of Cornwall.
What financial support will be given to those who are asked to isolate?
Given that we also know that black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more at risk from covid, will he now publish the PHE report on disparities in full—all the chapters, all the analysis, all the recommendations—because action to protect BAME people, especially BAME health and care staff, must be an urgent priority?",4920

2020-06-17,Coronavirus,e808.1,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25120,Jon Ashworth,Labour,Shadow Secretary of State for Health and Social Care,0,"I am grateful, Mr Speaker.
I welcome the news from the Secretary of State about Dexamethasone.
As he said, this is an important moment and good news, and I congratulate all those involved.
It is a reminder that we can be immensely proud of our science base in this country.
I note what the Secretary of State said about vaccinations.
A vaccine is crucial, and I hope he will join me—I am sure he will—in saying that when a vaccine is available, we must have no truck with those who spread poisonous anti-vax propaganda on social media.
Vaccinations save lives, and ultimately that will be the exit strategy from this dreadful, horrific disease.
The good news is tempered by the high death rate.
The Prime Minister likes to boast of flattening the sombrero, and it is certainly true that deaths from hospitalisations are coming down, but we still have 58,000 excess deaths across England and 13,000 in care homes; and 300 health and care staff have sadly lost their lives.
All our NHS staff deserve great praise, so may I ask the Health Secretary about a specific matter that has emerged in the past couple of days?
Why are student nurses who joined the frontline six months ago as part of the coronavirus effort now seeing their paid placement schemes terminated early, leaving them with no income?
That is no way to treat student nursing staff.
This week, the World Health Organisation has warned that the UK remains in a “very active phase of the pandemic”.
The right hon. Gentleman will accept that if a second wave comes, especially if it coincides with flu season, that would be completely disastrous.
Can he reassure the House that the decisions that he and the Prime Minister are making on easing lockdown measures, such as the mooted relaxation of the 2-metre rule and the opening of non-essential retail this week, will not precipitate a deadly second wave of the virus?
Would he update us on the latest thinking on that by the Home Department?
In the past, the right hon. Gentleman has said that he is prepared to institute local lockdowns, but local authorities continue to say that they do not have the resources or powers to enforce that.
Can he update us on when he will give local authorities powers to enforce those lockdowns?
Yesterday, the Health Service Journal said that for people in the shielding group, shielding will come to an end at the end of July.
We were promised a full update on shielding on 15 June, two days ago.
Can the right hon. Gentleman update the House now on what is happening and what the future is for the shielding group with regards to getting their medicines and supplies and whether they will be able to leave their homes by the end of July?
We have always said that testing, tracing and isolating is crucial to the safe easing of the lockdown.
On testing, local authorities say that they are still not getting the specific test data that they need.
Indeed, the Deloitte contract, as confirmed in a written answer from the Minister for Patient Safety, Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, did not specify that it needed to report test results to GPs and local directors of public health.
We need to fix that.
Why is the right hon. Gentleman still not publishing the number of people who have been tested, and can he explain something that is puzzling many of us?
The tracing figures that he revealed—we are grateful for them—suggested that 8,000 people went into the contact tracing system in England, but in that week, the Government testing figures said that there were around 12,500 positive cases in the UK.
Even if we can make an assumption about how many of those cases are in England, that still suggests that there are around 2,000, perhaps 3,000, cases not being traced and contacted.
Can he explain why that is and what he is going to do to fix it?
Finally, we have now seen Public Health England recommendations on the impact of covid on those from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.
Those recommendations are welcome.
Many of them, such as mandated ethnicity data collection and recordings on death certificates, should have been done years ago, but when will those recommendations be implemented?
Black people are nearly four times as likely to die from covid as white people, and over 90% of doctors who have died during the pandemic were from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, so surely this is a matter of urgency.
We cannot wait, and we need those recommendations to be implemented straight away.",3723

A peaceful protest—a peaceful protest—of those who wish to campaign about the conditions of asylum seekers has been met by a counter-demonstration of the far right who sought to disturb that particular demonstration.
I am sorry to see scenes of violence on social media in relation to the protest.
Let me be quite clear that I condemn the racism of the far right and I celebrate those who wish to protest about the unfair conditions that asylum seekers are faced with in Glasgow.
No doubt further news will develop as this debate goes on, but I want to make it quite clear that this demonstration tonight had nothing to do with statues, but was to address the issue of conditions in the city.
I thank you for allowing me to say that, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I thank Mr Speaker for granting this Adjournment debate on a topic that has gained much media interest both in the mainstream media and the new media outlets with some horrific stories of asylum seekers and their treatment by the Home Office contractor.
We have also seen the sorry sight of asylum charities having to submit supplementary written evidence to the Home Affairs Committee in response to Mears, the Home Office contractor, and the claims of how asylum seekers are being treated in Glasgow.
We have seen the campaigning ability of organisations such as Living Rent and the No Evictions!
campaign, organising to help their friends and neighbours.
There are a number of issues: first, the Home Office cannot be allowed to regress to business as usual, and it must fit with—and not fetter—devolved Government and local authority public health recovery plans.
I want to focus much of my remarks today on the asylum support regime, and the need for Ministers to act responsibly in full compliance with public health policy and, as such, with local and devolved Government covid-19 recovery plans.
I must start with the asylum support rates.
I understand that the Minister is well known for collecting data, so he will know that the asylum support moneys are only at about 42% of the social security breadline.
That is not a lot and is less than every other person in this country is entitled to.
I am not a data man.
I am more interested in real life, so, to illustrate, the data tell us that a 300-page pad and six pens are sufficient for a child’s home education.
That is what the methodology states, but even with the pitiful amount of £39 a week, the Home Office only raised the old rate by 26 pence per day.
I see asylum-seeking families every day.
There are 2,000 of them in Glasgow and I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that 20 pence per week is pitiful.

This increase was an insult to desperate people and children and to add to the injury officials quite callously did not make that data-driven decision until after lockdown, rather than before it.
I urge the Minister to look beyond the data and show a bit of leadership.
Perhaps he should give Marcus Rashford a call, because he can give Government some tips, as he told the Prime Minister, about real life, about children and parents going hungry, about how terrified mums and dads are about how their child will keep up at school when they go back to blended learning in August or September because, as we know, there is no wi-fi in asylum accommodation.

Gentleman for mentioning the asylum support work of Refugee Action and other charities, and I certainly support what he said today.
My constituent Simon wrote to me in advance of this debate:“Access to a mobile phone and the internet has never been more important.
As well as Refugee Week, this is also Loneliness Awareness Week and action is needed to address loneliness and social isolation in the asylum system, including by ensuring that people seeking asylum have the digital resources that they need to stay connected, access support and continue education.
”Simon goes on to say:“The UK continues to face a global health emergency that has disproportionately affected people from black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, including here in the UK, with many minorities living in deprivation simply left dead by covid-19, not protected adequately by the UK Government.
It remains vital that everyone, irrespective of their immigration status, can live in dignity, afford the most basic things and to be safe.”
My constituent Saffie also wrote to me:“Even before coronavirus I was barely surviving on around £5 per day.
We have to travel to the bigger shops that have lower prices, but now with lockdown we can’t travel and the small shops have hiked their prices.
Things like soap and hand sanitiser are very expensive and leave only a few pence for food and other essentials.
Since lockdown, essential support services…have closed their doors, so you have to have phone credit or data to even contact them for help.
This means deciding to eat or to get phone credit.
The recent increase of 26p per day to asylum support is heart breaking.
I just want to live in dignity, afford the most basic things and to be safe.”
My first question to the Minister is: as we come to Refugee Day this Saturday, will he please reconsider the asylum support rates, and will he promise not to penalise asylum-seeking families who receive digital packages and laptops so that their kids can keep up at school with blended learning?
The coronavirus is a public health crisis, but it is also a humanitarian crisis for people in the asylum process.
I turn now to a welcome and, in public health terms, essential safeguard to asylum accommodation when lockdown was announced.
It was stated that asylum seekers would not have their financial support and accommodation cut off—that they would not be evicted—and that that would last until, at the very least, the end of June.
As the Minister will be aware, we in Glasgow have called for an end to asylum homelessness and eviction for years.
Most recently, we resisted Serco when it tried and failed to make hundreds of people street homeless through cruel forced lock changes.
We showed the way, and we urge all dispersal areas to resist asylum accommodation evictions and homelessness.
I welcomed the pause in evictions, as did Glasgow city council and many other asylum local authorities, who for years have demanded that the Home Office take responsibility for the care of vulnerable asylum seekers, rather than shunt them heartlessly onto the streets.",2269

Through him, I say to the Minister that we need to look again at this idea of how we disperse asylum seekers throughout the city of Glasgow, moving them on so often.
Asylum seekers, who will often get involved in community group, a church or with charities, are frequently moved on to another area, where they will have no community support.
I commend what is being done, but if we are to have a wider conversation about accommodation, we need to impress upon the Minister the need for people to be able to stay in one part of Glasgow, rather being shunted around all the time, which is no good to them.",492

I will have some questions for the Minister about his contact with Glasgow City Council, but I am sure that all us Glasgow MPs would welcome any opportunity to meet him to address the many issues that asylum seekers face in the city of Glasgow, including how to give them better protection.
Let me tell the Minister that the asylum evictions policy has, way before covid-19, blighted the lives of women and men thrown into homelessness on to the streets of councils that have been, and remain, decimated by the Government’s austerity programme.
What a short-sighted and irresponsible policy austerity was.
It has been ruthlessly exposed by the dreadful covid-19 pandemic.
As the Health Secretary knows well, the facts are that we are no longer in a fragile recovery phase out of lockdown.
The virus is still out there and the R rate varies by locality.
It attacks the most vulnerable.
They were the most vulnerable before the pandemic, have been during it, and, unless the Government act, will be after it.
I and many others are furious to now learn that last Thursday, when I was being told that I had been selected for this debate and presumably in a ministerial office far from the streets of Glasgow, Liverpool, Swansea and Middlesbrough, the Government decided to restart support cessations and, by implication, the imminent eviction in July of asylum seekers, both those who have been granted refugee status and those who are being refused asylum.
That could mean hundreds and thousands of vulnerable asylum seekers rendered street homeless into an ongoing life-threatening pandemic.
To increase the risk, it will be happening in some of the most deprived communities in the United Kingdom.
I know that the Minister and his staff were telling local authorities in these areas last Friday that that is what they plan to do.
Let us just think about what that means.
The Government are getting back to the Home Office’s “business as usual” while everyone else in society is grappling with the new normal.
Why is the Home Office different?
This “business as usual” will make people street homeless at a time of an ongoing pandemic.
This is all to happen while all other evictions are rightly postponed.
The Housing Secretary in this place has paused evictions until the 23 August, so why have the Home Office not done the same?",2069

There should also be an equality impact assessment of the decisions the Government are making in that regard.
In cutting off support and making people homeless, the Government are not only placing them at acute health risk, including from covid-19, but are undermining the wider community and the local government and devolved Government recovery out of covid-19.
What was decided last Thursday is, in my view, deeply irresponsible.
I urge the Minister to reconsider, and I know I am not alone in that.
I know that local authorities and, I am sure, public health directors feel the same way.
It is basic common sense that you do not evict anyone into homelessness during an ongoing pandemic.
It is inexcusable, especially for asylum seekers and those in the black and minority ethnic community.",746

I am sorry I missed the beginning of the debate.
I am sure he has mentioned, or will mention, the attacks they have come under in Glasgow tonight.
Does he agree that another issue with asylum seekers being made street homeless is that if the people campaigning for them are being attacked by the far right just for supporting them, they will be in even more danger and that makes it even more irresponsible?",620

There is no place for far-right thuggery anywhere in the United Kingdom.
People are entitled to protest peacefully if they think the Government are not making the correct decisions.
A peaceful protest was planned for tonight and they were met with thugs.
I am sure that we will see and hear more about that on the news later this evening.
I have a couple of questions for the Minister.
May I urge him to please urgently reconsider and confirm to me today in writing that he will not restart any support cessations, or the evictions that will inevitably follow, without the express agreement of asylum local authorities, public health directors, and, where relevant, devolved Administrations?
Will he confirm that the last meeting to have taken place with local authorities, political leaders and Ministers was just less than a year ago, when the right hon. Member for Romsey and Southampton North (Caroline Nokes) was the Immigration Minister?
What does that say about the Home Office and its relations with political leaders in local government dispersal areas?
Can he tell us when the next meeting with the local government dispersal areas will be?
On the acute risk of covid-19 and severe illness and death for BAME communities, I turn briefly to a critical matter touched on earlier that is of the utmost public interest.
As the evidence is now overwhelming that BAME communities living in areas of deprivation and often higher population density are at an acutely high risk of contracting covid-19 or of dying from it, this already high risk will escalate if BAME communities are made homelessness.
The asylum seekers are from BAME groups, with people from Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Nigeria, Sudan, Afghanistan, and China, among many others.
They are at a higher risk of dying from covid-19.
Surely given that, the Minister must not end, but extend, the ban on asylum support cessation and evictions.
It would be even more irresponsible in public health and safety terms to restart business as usual.
Given the evidence about those who are homeless catching covid-19 and, for BAME communities, of dying from it, will the Minister urgently extend the ban on asylum support cessation and evictions, and set out how he is paying due regard to this public sector equality duty in deciding to end the current pause on cessation and evictions?
My third point is about hotel detentions, which was the subject of tonight’s peaceful protest in Glasgow.
I have read the exchanges between Mears and the Home Affairs Committee.
I have seen that the asylum charities have had to supply supplementary evidence.
I have read the reports in the media and new media, and I have read the Minister’s letter to Councillor Jen Layden, so let me lay out the facts.
A decision was taken by Mears in the first week of lockdown, on 23 March, to quickly uproot 300 asylum seekers from single-occupancy or two-bedroom serviced apartments in the city—de facto households—into hotels.
Asylum seekers have contacted my office and the offices of asylum charities to say that asylum seekers were bundled into vans with no social distancing and transported to these hotels—not quality hotels by any manner of means.
In some of these hotels, the food provided has been mouldy and unfit for consumption, and in some it is culturally inappropriate, to the extent that around 20 asylum seekers are currently on hunger strike.
Asylum seekers have contacted my office to say that, due to the food provided, they have been unwell.
That is not acceptable.
It is so bad that charities have had no other choice than to step in and provide food.
I can confirm, as a trustee of the Feeding Britain charity, that it has agreed to contribute to the provision of meals that are of sufficient quality and cultural appropriateness for families.
I should add that 300-plus people uprooted from their serviced apartment accommodation, on arrival in the hotels, had all financial support cut off, which is not something that was required by asylum support.
However, the Government and the Department chose to do that, and people are suffering every day.
How would we feel when we leave this room today—how would any of us feel—if we were told that we had no money at all?
There is no social distancing and health concerns are too often ignored or met with a dismissive attitude.
Claims made in ministerial correspondence that organisations such as the Red Cross and the Scottish Refugee Council have inspected the site and raised no concerns are denied by those organisations.
As the Red Cross put it:“I have confirmed with our operational staff that the offer of a visit to hotel accommodation was not taken up by our staff due to public health guidelines advising against all non-essential travel, this however may change as we transition out of lock down”.
The Scottish Refugee Council said:“We declined the first invite to a hotel for lockdown public health reasons.
We accepted the second invite to visit one of seven hotels in use, which we did, but we said to Mears before then, during it and after that visit, that there is not much we can meaningfully say on conditions and how people feel, on the basis of one short visit to one location.
Mears accepted this was the case.”
It is the case that the decision to place asylum seekers into hotels results in those individuals losing that state financial support.
The argument that this is not a cost-cutting exercise just does not wash, and sadly, there has been one tragic death.
Can the Minister confirm whether, on what date and to whom in Glasgow City Council Mears gave notice of the plan, with effect from 27 March, to move those 300-plus asylum seekers who were already on section 98 support and who were in serviced apartments in the city?
Did Mears not give advance notice to the council in that regard?",5480

Does my hon.

Friend that the Home Office must immediately intervene and establish the facts in that regard.
If people need medical care, they should get medical care.
Indeed, the Minister’s letter to Councillor Jennifer Layden outlines that there is supposed to be immediate medical care for those asylum seekers who are in hotels.
A further question to the Minister relates to deaths that take place in asylum accommodation.
Will he set out what steps his Department takes in relation to a death in asylum accommodation?
I understand that he may not be able to talk about the current case, but can he signpost me to the policy that the Home Office follows in these situations?
Lastly, can he tell me when hotel detentions will end and when asylum seekers will be returned to suitable accommodation?
In closing, I can tell the Minister that Glasgow is a political village.
People know when someone is not telling the truth or the full facts.
They know when someone is trying to pull the wool over their eyes.
A number of things in his correspondence to the council are simply not the case.
In Glasgow, asylum seekers are our neighbours and friends.
They are part of the community.
Any move to detain them in hotels or to evict them from their accommodation will be met with the same resistance that led to the rent strikes led by the great Mary Barbour, and the same resistance shown by the great Glasgow Girls.

Without doubt, the nation needs a full independent public inquiry into the Government’s handling of the covid crisis, but one area in particular that demands scrutiny is the Government’s handling of the effects of covid-19 on the black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.
Why have Ministers ignored the evidence, dragged their feet and almost certainly contributed to a situation where people from BAME communities have been disproportionately ravaged by this terrible disease?
For me, this is personal.
I have lost loved ones to covid, such as Jagir Kaur, my lovely grandmother, our family matriarch, from whom I learnt so much, but whose coffin I was not even able to carry on my shoulder.
Satnam Singh Dhesi, my fun-loving, Slough taxi-driver uncle was taken away from us way too early, and then I had to endure the indignity of watching his funeral online via Zoom.
Hemraj Jaymal, my brother-in-law’s father, somehow contracted covid in a Slough care home, and, inexcusably, none of us was there to hold his hand when he breathed his last.
May they all rest in peace and may we be forgiven for not being there.
Families cannot attend bedsides and because the usual rituals and rights of funerals are disrupted, it makes loss even harder and grief even harsher, and there are tens of thousands of people suffering bereavement.
Back in April, we saw BAME people being disproportionately affected by covid-19 as data came in from emergency admissions to hospital from more than three months ago.
On 22 May, King’s College London research showed that patients from BAME groups admitted to hospital with covid-19 are, on average, a decade younger than white patients.
In May, the Office for National Statistics reported that black people were more than four times more likely to die from covid-19 than their white counterparts; that Bangladeshi and Pakistani people were more than one and a half times more likely to die from covid-19; and that the situation was similar for people with an Indian heritage.
That was published more than a month ago.
Of course, Ministers have had a wealth of evidence from BAME organisations presented to Public Health England, which Ministers initially tried to delay, then cover-up and have released under pressure only this week.
The evidence tells us what we already knew: ethnic inequalities in health and wellbeing in the UK existed before COVID-19, and the pandemic has made these disparities more apparent and undoubtedly exacerbated them.
Why is this?
One major reason is racism, and this racism, unfortunately, is also within our lovely NHS.
Figures released last week by the NHS Confederation show that the number of ethnic minority chairs and non-executive directors of NHS trusts in England has almost halved from 15% in 2010 to a mere 8% in 2018.
Quoted in the Eastern Eye newspaper, Dr Ramesh Mehta, the president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, said that this was down to “rampant discrimination” and a “club culture” within NHS professions.
Representation matters, and the dismally low number of executive directors of NHS trusts is inexcusable.
If BAME doctors and nurses are good enough to die on the frontline, surely they are good enough to lead.
While I am proud to be a part of the most diverse party and the most diverse Parliament ever, the lack of leadership positions in most key industries is shocking, including the all-important finance sector, where the majority of FTSE companies still have all-white boards.
Rather than just tweeting about Black Lives Matter, those companies need to take a long hard look at themselves to judge whether they are indeed a part of the change that they proclaim to be.
Diversity is crucial because it brings in people with fresh perspectives and different priorities, thereby enhancing and improving the overall performance for all of us, so perhaps the Minister can comment on how she intends to tackle the racial discrimination within the NHS.
It took until 16 June for Public Health England to publish its seven-point plan, but surely this should have been done from the very start.
We do not just want to carry on collating data.
Of course I pay tribute to the frontline NHS staff across my Slough constituency, including at Wexham Park Hospital, who undoubtedly face incredible challenges and risks, but the British Medical Association reports that 90% of doctors and 60% of NHS staff who have died are from BAME backgrounds.
Those absolutely staggering statistics should make us realise that something is very wrong.
We are lacking time, so in conclusion I want to ask the Minister to reflect on the plans to commemorate all those who have lost their lives, with a focal point of remembrance, and assure us that we will learn the lessons.
More than anything, I hope she can allay my concerns.

“Unprecedented” is a word we have heard bandied around a lot in the last few months.
The new ways of working and interacting with our communities may be unprecedented, but sadly, the effect of covid-19 on black and minority ethnic communities does have precedent.
If the Government had taken the findings of previous reports seriously, not only is it possible that many of these black and minority ethnic deaths could have been avoided, but we would not once again have to be asking the Government to ensure that more people do not lose their lives to this horrible disease.
In 2017, the Lammy review and the race disparity audit were published.
Both highlighted the structural inequalities experienced by black and minority ethnic communities.
Asian and black households and those in other ethnic minority groups were more likely to be poorer and most likely to be in persistent poverty.
The ethnic minority population is more likely to live in areas of deprivation—especially black, Pakistani and Bangladeshi people.
Around one in 10 adults from black, Pakistani, Bangladeshi or mixed backgrounds were unemployed, compared with one in 25 white British people.
Overcrowding affects ethnic minority households disproportionately.
London has one of the highest rates of overcrowding of all regions in England.
There has been an increase in the number of ethnic minority households accepted by local authorities as statutorily homeless over the last decade.
The Government will tell us that tackling racism is at the core of their efforts.
Last week, I asked the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government how much it spends on tackling racism.
The response said that the Department“paid approximately £219,00 to projects specifically to target racism in the financial year 19/20.
”People across this nation are watching.
Black and minority ethnic communities have faced structural racism for decades, and we are having to have the same conversations 20 years on.
People are concerned and, rightly, angry.
Although I support both Show Racism the Red Card and the Anne Frank Trust, which the Government fund, is this the message that the Government want to give—just £219,000 of the Department’s annual budget is spent on racism, yet the Prime Minister is willing to spend £900,000 on rebranding his plane?
Can somebody tell me what kind of message that sends to our country?
The message is that this Government care more about the colour of a plane than fighting racism, bigotry and discrimination for people of colour.
Is this the message the Government are sending?
Is that the Government’s priority?
And they wonder why people are so angry.
Morally, the Government’s priorities are not in the right place and nor are they economically.
The McGregor-Smith review found that black and minority ethnic career progression could add £24 billion a year to the UK’s economy.
If we could tackle racial inequality, we would be billions better-off.
Yet I ask the Government how much they are spending specifically on tackling this type of race inequality.
If the Minister wants to tell the House how much is spent on trying to retrieve up to £24 billion lost to the economy, I am happy to give way.
On 9 April, I also wrote to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.
Over the past few months, the Government have published significant material on covid-19 restrictions and guidelines on the Government website, and Ministers have been briefing the nation on air every single day.
Yet I have still not received a response, despite me reaching out to the Government to support them in their efforts to reach minority communities.
On a community level in Bradford West, the Al Markaz Medics, the Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the Bradford Council for Mosques all put out their own communication.
It did not come from the Government.
Nationally, lot of organisations such as the Muslim Council of Britain did what they needed to do for their own communities, but the Government did not.
We have had to take it upon ourselves.
The Government failed to acknowledge the significant language barriers that exist in communities, despite this being a pandemic where everyone has needed to receive clear messaging.
I am a former commissioner.
From my commissioning days, I remember the Rocky Bennett inquiry.
In 1998, Rocky Bennett was held down by five nurses.
He could not breathe either and he died.
The report, published over 20 years ago, made recommendations to the Department of Health to“cure this festering abscess”—racism—“which is a blot upon the good name of the NHS.
”Rocky Bennett was a 38-year-old black man with huge ambitions who had been offered a traineeship with Chelsea.
Structural inequalities are what this comes down to.
Even in this place last year, a young man who had grown his Afro for years had to cut it to even be considered for an interview.
Structural racism exists in this place.
The Government need to listen and stop papering over with more reviews.
We know what the issues are.
Now is the time for action.",7557

I thank the hon. Member for Brent Central (Dawn Butler) for her trenchant speech in opening this debate.
Members have risen to speak in the House on matters relating to inequality and BAME communities with depressing regularity over the years.
I thank the right hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Theresa Villiers) for saying we have come a long way.
I will refer a little to my own history.
I am very aware that I am a white woman speaking on this matter, but before moving to Wales I was raised in Eltham, in south-east London.
Stephen Lawrence’s murder in 1993 compelled that community—my old home community—to deeply question its values.
The Macpherson report in 1999 made 70 recommendations aimed at tackling institutional racism, primarily within the criminal justice system, yet 20 years later and black people in Wales are five times over-represented in the prison population, Asian people are 1.7 times over-represented, and people from a mixed ethnic group are 2.7 times over-represented.
This is a significant indicator of the structural racism and inequality in our society.
This is the hard reality of criminal justice and inequality.
Our police forces are indeed very different from those of 1993, but disproportionately too many young men and women have blighted lives and spend much of their lives in the criminal justice system.
Those figures reveal that all the good intentions of report after review after commission in no way reflect the lived experience of too many black people, and this is the background of today’s debate.
Many hon. Members have spoken already today about the pernicious effect of institutional racism within healthcare and the wider community.
Many have questioned why it has taken the covid-19 crisis to make heroes of health and care staff and to show us clearly exactly how many of those frontline workers are from BAME communities.
Representing a constituency now in north-west Wales, I hope that one of the messages we can get from this is: look at how dependent we are on people and look at what the outcomes have been for these people.
Are we content for our society to ignore this?
Members have pointed out the obvious: there have been enough reviews, enough commissions and enough descriptions of how racism oozes from private attitudes into public experience.
Covid-19 and the Black Lives Matter campaign together are reforging our values and forcing us to question our cultural heritage.
Thinking again of Stephen Lawrence and all the battles that his brave parents, Neville and Doreen Lawrence, have fought in the intervening years, the people my family knew in Eltham back then did not think of themselves as racists and we did not think of ourselves as racists, but look what happened in Well Hall Road.
People like us would have been horrified to be called racists and people like us are still horrified to be called racists, but that is not enough, is it?
It is not enough to be not racist.
Our social media feeds tonight will almost certainly include comments that “all lives matter”.
Of course all lives matter, but it is not an indictment of anybody for us to be calling for this particular attention.
One person’s gain is not another person’s loss.
If we are not racists, we must be anti-racist.
Do not commission; act on what we already know.",2857

In her maiden speech, my predecessor, Jo Cox, said of Batley and Spen:“Our communities have been deeply enhanced by immigration, be it of Irish Catholics across the constituency, or of Muslims from Gujarat in India or from Pakistan, principally from Kashmir.”—[Official Report, 3 June 2015; Vol. 596, c. 674.
]
I quote Jo Cox in the week of the fourth anniversary of her murder, and she is still desperately missed in this place and in Batley and Spen.
That quote perfectly describes the diversity of my constituency.
That community is already exposed to underlying health conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and asthma, and we now know that there is also a raised risk of death involving covid-19, when compared with people of white ethnicity.
As a proud GMB MP, I know that GMB supports many thousands of ancillary staff, from hospital porters to cleaners, ambulance workers and admin staff, and it has pressed for risk assessments.
Sadly, those risk assessments came too late for many staff, and when they did come, they focused on access to PPE and social distancing challenges.",1251

Friend and I might have been on the EveryDoctor briefing together, which highlighted that although BAME staff make up 17% of the NHS workforce, only 11% of them are in senior management, and that figure then drops to 6.4%.
A BMA survey stated that 64% of BAME staff felt pressured into working without PPE, compared with 33% of non- BAME staff.",130

We must not allow pressure on people to do their job to affect health outcomes for them and their family, and I thank her for that brilliant intervention.
With all that in mind, plus the fact that Pakistani deaths are 2.9 times as high as deaths among white British people, it sadly seems as though my diverse constituency is at a greater risk of being disproportionately affected by covid-19.
It is therefore with some optimism and relief that I note the most recent statistics, which show that the Kirklees local authority area remains one of the lowest affected by covid per size of population, with 179.6 cases per 100,000 people.
On Tuesday this week, no new deaths were recorded at Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust over the previous 24 hours.
These low figures clearly reflect the sacrifices of the people of Kirklees and of Batley and Spen, who listened to Government advice and followed the guidance to protect our NHS.
I would like to thank the leadership of Kirklees Council and of Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, who have worked tirelessly to keep the public and stakeholders informed so that we can all work together to keep people safe.
One serious worry is that the results of the covid testing regime are being held centrally and not shared with the trust, which could make the most of the data in an increasingly fluid situation.
That does seem extremely odd.
Our NHS trust is the local expert and the institution that people look to to keep them safe, so if it could factor in testing—how many tests are done and in what geographical location—and build a response based on the breakdown and composition of positive results, we would all be better served.
The impact on my community goes further than falling ill.
The economic impact also affects my BAME community more deeply than others as we are a large manufacturing region and manufacturing is particularly exposed in an economic downturn.
As the Institute for Fiscal Studies data showed only this week, workers in shut-down sectors are more likely than average to be BAME women and part-time workers, with 15% from BAME backgrounds in comparison with the workforce average of 12%.
Let us not forget that these are a group of workers already disadvantaged in the labour market, with the ONS showing pre-covid BAME unemployment at 6.3% in January to March 2020, compared with 3.9% of the whole population.
Anxiety about money and job prospects will also have a profound impact on their mental health.
As we know, according to the report from Public Health England, racism can make people from BAME backgrounds less likely to ask for help or insist on PPE.
Some 90% of the doctors who died during the pandemic were from BAME backgrounds.
Doctors from these communities were three times more likely to say that they had felt pressured to work without protective equipment.
We must do more to tackle institutionalised racism in the care sector and the NHS.
For that to happen, we need to have better data reporting, to support those in low-paid jobs to speak up, to develop a risk assessment for BAME staff members exposed to large numbers of the general public, to deliver culturally sensitive messaging across the community and to intensify health messages around the conditions that can lead to vulnerability.
Before I finish, let me say that each and every one of the statistics has family and friends mourning their loss.
I would like to pay tribute to the wonderful, thoughtful and very well liked Dr Nasir Khan, who worked on one of the medical wards at Dewsbury and District Hospital in my constituency.
He fell ill with the virus last month and, as a resident of Bolton, was admitted to Bolton NHS Foundation Trust, where he sadly died.
His son made a moving tribute to his father.
He ended with the words:“We strive to achieve the greatness that was my dad and fulfil the dreams he has left behind.
Let us hope that Dr Khan’s sacrifice was not in vain, and that Government will now implement the changes needed to ensure that black, Asian and minority ethnic workers are not allowed to be collateral damage in this fight.",3188

It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Ilford South (Sam Tarry).
I add my voice to those paying tribute and thanks to the hon. Member for Brent Central (Dawn Butler) for introducing the debate.
I have to say I am disappointed and ashamed that we have got to this stage in our country.
Here we are in 2020, and it has taken a pandemic like covid-19 and the protests from BLM to make us recognise something that was in front of us all along.
Covid-19 has certainly shone a very stark spotlight on our society, and shown quite clearly that there are cracks that we may have thought we had mended, and inequalities that we hoped we had addressed.
There are still gaping holes, and inequalities that have gone not just unaddressed but largely unacknowledged.
Our society’s acute emotional response to the disproportionate impact of covid-19 on BAME communities has been perhaps the one saving grace in this shocking failure to protect our communities, so many of whom were at the forefront of tackling the virus and have paid the ultimate price.
The impact of covid-19 is only part of that unacceptable picture.
Another is the economic crisis, which may grow and which is also hitting our BAME communities particularly hard.
They are disproportionately likely to be on zero-hours contracts.
Only 31% of BAME workers have been furloughed; 20% have already lost their jobs.
If the Government are serious about tackling the systemic racial inequality that is now absolutely and undeniably clear in this country, what we need is not just another review setting out specific points.
There are immediate steps that they could take.
They could scrap the hostile environment.
They could stop suspicionless stop-and-search.
They could amend the Domestic Abuse Bill.
There are so many steps that they could take now.
The review is a first step, and I hope that it will make recommendations, but we already have 35 recommendations in the Lammy report, 110 in the Angiolini review, 30 in the Windrush lessons learned review, and 26 in Baroness McGregor-Smith’s review.
We have reports, reviews and recommendations on the shelves in Whitehall, which are weighed down with them.
What we need now is action.
More than that, I believe we need a race equality strategy for the whole of the UK.
If this Government are serious about tackling racial injustice, that is what they need.
The commission may be a first step, and it shows that the BLM protests are having an impact, but it must not be a way of avoiding tackling the issues that they have brought to light.
We need that racial equality strategy.
In truth, we needed it decades ago.
So often I have believed that we were turning a corner.
So many of us hoped—indeed, believed—that the Macpherson report after the murder of Stephen Lawrence would prove a turning point.
We now realise that despite all the work that has been done by so many people, there is so much—too much—still to do.
We cannot afford another false dawn in this country.
I am disappointed that I cannot pay tribute to the BAME community in my constituency or anywhere in Scotland and talk about the impact on them, because National Records of Scotland does not record deaths by ethnicity—it is voluntary—so the impact could be anywhere between 1% and 10%.
I find it unacceptable that the Scottish Government do not have the figures to recognise that and address the issue in the way that we are at least attempting to in Westminster.
I ask them to do that now.
In fact, I ask our Ministers here at Westminster to impress on the Government in Scotland the need to act now, so that we can have a cross-government race equality strategy like the one recommended by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, effective across the United Kingdom.
This has been a difficult time for all of us.
Standing here as a white woman, I acknowledge that, while I might sympathise, I cannot fully feel the injustice that so many of our communities are feeling today.
But I do know that we all feel that this must be our moment for change.
We have to change our society, and we have to change it now.",4426

It is a pleasure to follow the sage, sad and passionate contribution from the hon. Member for Edinburgh West (Christine Jardine).
In Newham, we have statistically the second highest mortality rate from covid in the country.
We have lost Ramesh Gunamal, who worked on the front desk at Forest Gate police station.
We have lost Dr Louisa Rajakumari, who taught English at Kingsford Community School.
We have lost Dr Yusuf Patel, a much missed GP from Forest Gate, and Abdul Karim Sheikh—sometimes a political opponent, mostly a friend, and a man always dedicated to the best for our communities.
Those are just a few of the people who Newham and West Ham mourn deeply.
We know that deprivation doubles the risk from covid, and Newham is deprived—of that, there is no doubt.
Like many of my friends’ areas, we have beautifully diverse communities, which means that they have been hurt massively by the pandemic.
Those from our Bangladeshi community have twice the risk of death, and that is more than 12% of my constituents.
Those from the Pakistani community have a 44% higher risk, which is 10% of us in Newham.
Those from the Indian community have a 22% higher risk, which is 15% of us in Newham.
Those from the black Caribbean and black African communities have a 10% and 6% higher risk, which is 4% and 11% of us in Newham.
Some 73% of us in Newham are from an ethnic minority, so we need this Government to act before we see a second wave.
We need action so desperately that I have broken shielding to be here today so that I can demand it.
The fact that I had to do so is wrong, but that is not nearly as wrong as the denial of equal protection for my constituents from this terrible virus.
I have written to the Minister for Women and Equalities, the Health Secretary and others about this twice.
The first letter was sent more than six weeks ago.
I do not think the urgency of my language could have been misunderstood.
I wrote again two weeks ago, expressing, again, a desperate need for action.
I have received absolutely no response of value.
However, I was pleased to hear yesterday that there is finally going to be an urgent review of evidence and possible action on vitamin D deficiency.
I hope we get that very, very soon, because if there is a second wave and we have constituents dying for the simple lack of a vitamin supplement, the Government know there will be a price to pay.
We know that it goes further than vitamin D. Staggeringly, despite the fact that black and minority ethnic communities are at greater risk of death, they are under-represented in clinical trials.
Why?
What possible excuse is there for that?
In my humble opinion, it is incompetence, at the very best.
Let us look at the Government’s approach to covid-19 across this pandemic: it has been about slowing down its spread, which depends on two weeks’ full isolation.
But in poor communities where there is no spare cash— there are no savings—excessive living costs have to be met week in, week out.
Frankly, we all know that statutory sick pay just is not enough to keep people afloat, so sick people go to work.
They put themselves at risk, they put the people on the tube with them at risk, they put the people who are on buses with them at risk, and they put their co-workers at risk, all because they are not paid enough money to enable them to stay at home like the rest of us can do, and recover.
The Government have not even suspended the no recourse to public funds policy so that people can isolate.
Why?
Why do they not understand what these actions mean?
In Newham, many of us live in overcrowded homes—even my home feels a bit overcrowded at the moment with just me and my husband—which means that people at home cannot self-isolate.
I accept that the Government are not going to be able to eliminate overcrowding overnight, but it would be great if they made a start.
The fact that they cannot means that the other policies, such as track and trace, are really important.
If we have a second wave, as I fear, and black and minority ethnic communities die in numbers out of all proportion again, we will be holding the Government to account for those excess deaths.",4177

Friend the Member for Brent Central (Dawn Butler) on securing this important—indeed, essential—debate.
Her opening speech was incredibly powerful.
She set out eloquently the relationship between the Black Lives Matter movement and black key workers dying.
She showed the connection between George Floyd’s long, slow death and his dying words, and Belly Mujinga dying of covid-19 here.
My hon. Friend said that being black is a pre-existing condition.
It is a condition that I celebrate—I am proud to be a black, Geordie, Nigerian, Irish Brit—but it should not be a co-morbidity.
My right hon. and hon. Friends have said so much that is so true, so eloquently—one of the joys of being a Labour MP is the support of my brothers and sisters—that I shall focus my remarks on three things: what covid-19 tells us about the reality of racism today; what it tells us about the failure of this Government on racism today; and what it tells us what about what the Government should do.
First, let me address the realities of structural racism today.
Like the Home Secretary, I experienced significant racism as a child, including name calling and worse, although I was supported by a strong community, family and school.
Over the last few years, name calling, physical abuse and hate crimes have unfortunately risen, but when the name calling stops, that does not mean that racism has gone away.
It is instead in the structures and systems that define how we live.
That is what we mean by structural racism: crowding BAME people into worse housing; putting up barriers to BAME people going into higher-paid professions; making it more likely for BAME people to live in deprived areas and have to take up precarious jobs; and putting BAME workers in the lower-paid roles in the NHS, while the higher-paid upper echelons remain snowy white.
Some 14% of the UK population are black, but 34% of those who work in intensive care are BAME.
The statistics that demonstrate the levels of inequality that still exist in our society are one of the reasons why the Black Lives Matter movement has such resonance here.
Some 25% of BAME nursing staff have no confidence that their employer is doing enough to protect them from covid-19.
BAME staff networks in the north-east have called for the risk assessments to which they are entitled to ensure they are protected.
That is the reality of racism today, and covid illustrates the Government’s response to it.
Whether it is a Foreign Secretary who thinks that taking the knee is from fantasy fiction or a Prime Minister who speaks of “smiling piccaninnies”, the Government have demonstrated a lack of interest in the racism that we face.
We do not need another report; we do not need another investigation.
We have enough recommendations.
This Government need to take action.
Covid-19 has shone a light on the discrimination that so many black and minority ethnic people suffer in this country.
The Government need to act to change that and ensure that it does not continue, as it has for so many years.
We do not need another review.
I am proud that, in Newcastle, our community stands strong together in its different identities and works together.
I was deeply saddened by the violence in our city this weekend.
Valuing black lives is not about devaluing white lives; it is about asking why black lives are more likely to be lost.
The Government have waited far too long to look for an answer to that question.
They must now take action to ensure that we are not in the same situation in a year, five years or 10 years.",3257
2020-06-18,Covid-19: BAME Communities,c1027.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25759,Florence Eshalomi,Labour,Opposition Whip (Commons),0,"I am delighted to speak in this debate, and I want to thank my hon. Friend the Member for Brent Central (Dawn Butler) for securing it.
I am proud to represent the diverse constituency of Vauxhall in Parliament, not least because my constituents have fought on the frontline of this pandemic, including at St Thomas’s Hospital, where our Prime Minister was treated so well.
But tragically, we have seen more than 500 deaths in my borough of Lambeth as a result of coronavirus, and 40% of those deaths have been black, Asian and minority ethnic people.
Those deaths are not just statistics.
They are mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters.
They are sons and daughters and they are grandparents.
A number of my constituents were not able to say goodbye to their loved ones.
Public Health England has found that the death rate from covid-19 is much higher for people from BAME backgrounds than for white ethnic groups.
It has also found that black males are 3.9 times more likely to die than white males, and that black females are 3.3 times more likely to die.
This is not a coincidence.
We should not be surprised or devastated by these statistics—shocked, yes; surprised, no.
The report shows that BAME communities continue to catch covid-19 and that they are more likely to live in overcrowded housing, more likely to live in deprived areas and more likely to have jobs that expose them to this deadly disease.
I might add that it is those crucial jobs that have kept our country going over the last few months: the bus drivers, the nurses, the midwives, the care workers, the taxi drivers and the security guards.
They are really crucial jobs.
Nor should we be surprised to read in the report that the pre-existing structural inequalities that BME communities face are a factor in those high death rates.
For me, the most damning sentence in the report reads:
“It confirms that the impact of COVID-19 has replicated existing health inequalities and, in some cases, has increased them.
”It is there in black and white.
Those deaths cannot and should not be separated from the tragic death of Belly Mujinga here in the UK, or from the shocking death of George Floyd in the USA.
Those deaths cannot and should not be separated from the deeply entrenched structural inequality and racism that our BME communities continue to face every single day.
We cannot begin to tackle the disproportionate impact of this virus until we acknowledge the deep-rooted cause and the deep-seated racism that still tragically exists in 2020.
That is the racism that I and many other colleagues on both sides of this Chamber have faced, and we have spoken about it in this Chamber.
We continue to experience that racism.
The report also highlights the direction that we should be taking.
It concludes:“These results improve our understanding of the pandemic and will help in formulating the future public health response to it.
”It goes on to say:“It seems likely that it will be difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 unless these inequalities can be addressed.
”They have to be addressed.
If the Government are really serious about tackling this real issue and making sure that we have concrete action to tackle racial inequality in our society, they must show leadership by acting on the failures that have led us to this debate today.",4205

Bristol was of course very much in the forefront of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations earlier this month with what our Mayor, Marvin Rees, the first democratically elected black Mayor in Europe, described as an act of “historical poetry”—the hugely symbolic removal by protesters of the statue of Edward Colston.
The Observer headline this Sunday was, “The day Bristol dumped its hated slave trader in the docks and a nation began to search its soul” but in fact the reverberations from the removal of Colston were not just national but global.
What is interesting is that the statue of Colston was not erected until 1895, more than 170 years after he died.
Professor Madge Dresser says that was part of a bid by the city elite to quell increasingly radical stirrings among the lower classes.
They were trying to rally people around a civic identity based, supposedly, on our glory days—our heyday, when the city prospered as a result of slavery—rather than have people rallying around class or an organised labour movement.
It is fitting, now that Colston has come down, that we do not just talk about statues and monuments and about place names and road names, although all that discussion is happening, but that we shine a light on structural inequalities, class, poverty, deprivation and health inequalities.
Earlier in the covid crisis, Bristol City Council, under the leadership of Mayor Marvin Rees and our Deputy Mayor Councillor Asher Craig, commissioned a rapid research review from University of Bristol academics.
The resulting report on the impact of covid-19 on black, Asian and minority ethnic communities was published on 20 May.
The verdict, as we heard from the Public Health England report and we know from our own experience, was that the risk from covid-19 is generally higher among BAME communities, even after adjusting for risk factors such as age, gender, comorbidities, increased likelihood to live in urban areas, and so on.
BAME people are more likely to be admitted to critical care and more likely to die.
No one factor alone can explain it, but contributing factors include being poorer, where people live, overcrowded housing, types of jobs, other illnesses and access to the health service.
The recommendations in the Bristol report include ensuring adequate income protection for those in low-paid or precarious employment and reducing occupational risk; what other Members said about the increased vulnerability of BAME healthcare staff and other frontline workers, such as Belly Mujinga, is really important.
The report also said that we need to improve public health communications and tailor them to culturally specific challenges, such as preventing transmission in overcrowded households or shielding vulnerable people in multi-generational households.
It also called for the removal of all NHS charges so that no migrant or individual from a BAME group delays seeking healthcare or risks death through fear of being charged for their NHS care.
It was quite shocking, as my right hon. Friend the Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms) said, that the Prime Minister did not even seem to know what “no recourse to public funds” meant when he appeared in front of the Liaison Committee.
The report also recommended that ethnic groups should be included in health inequalities work, that we should collect more data, and that there should be meaningful engagement and involvement of minority ethnic communities in the services.
This is now being taken forward by a BAME working group.
In research published in January 2017 looking at ethnic inequalities in education and employment, the Runnymede Trust judged Bristol to be one of the most unequal cities in the UK and one of the worst places when it came to racial equality.
We ranked seventh out of the 348 districts of England and Wales on the index of multiple inequality.
We are seemingly prosperous; people think of Bristol as a wealthy, thriving city.
We are the only city outside London to make a net contribution to GDP.
We are consistently voted as one of the coolest cities and one of the best places to visit.
All that gloss masks the underlying inequalities.
In the same way that the Colston statue presented a false image of wealth and philanthropy masking the true horrors of how many were enslaved, mistreated and died in the pursuit of that wealth, the gloss is masking the real picture in many of the deprived communities in Bristol.
We absolutely know that we have a long way to go in Bristol—that taking down the statue is just one historical marker on a long, sometimes difficult and sometimes daunting journey—but we are absolutely committed to doing this.",4653

Friend the Member for Brent Central (Dawn Butler) on securing this important and timely debate, and on her excellent speech.
Some 16% of the population in my constituency come from a black and minority ethnic background, and even before we knew the hard data about covid-19 deaths, the BAME community could sense that it was disproportionately affected.
My local community joined in mourning the tragic death of 26-year-old care worker, Sonya Kaygan.
Sonya died from covid-19 in mid-April after being exposed to coronavirus in the care home where she worked.
Sonya leaves behind a three-year-old daughter, who is now growing up without a mother.
Sadly, Sonya is one of thousands of people from the BAME community who worked in frontline services and have lost their lives.
As we watched the news and heard about the disproportionate number of BAME lives being lost, people rightly asked, “Why is this happening to our community?”
Although some of it can be put down to social gatherings between different communities, that is by no means the only explanation.
Two weeks ago Public Health England published its first report on the disparities in the risks and outcomes of covid-19, but although it showed the bare facts it provided no explanations, which led to more questions than answers.
Why were BAME Britons who contracted coronavirus twice as likely to die as white Britons?
Why do black and Asian groups have the highest death rates from coronavirus?
Why was race and ethnicity such a prevalent factor in the death stats?
Last week, we learned of the existence of Public Health England’s second report “Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on BAME groups”, which had not been released.
It made for shocking reading.
The report stated that structural racism had significantly impacted the effect of covid-19 on the BAME community, and that historical racism had made BAME NHS staff less likely to speak up about a lack of personal protective equipment or the increased risks they faced.
Dr Chaand Nagpaul, who chairs the British Medical Association, said in response to the report that more than 90% of doctors who died during the pandemic were from BAME backgrounds, and that BAME staff were three times as likely to say that they felt pressured to work without sufficient PPE.
The PHE report echoed those comments and stated:“Historic racism and poorer experiences of healthcare or at work mean that BAME individuals are less likely to seek care when they needed it”and they are also less likely to speak up if they have concerns about risks in the workplace.
The report further states:
The PHE report echoed those comments and stated:“Historic racism and poorer experiences of healthcare or at work mean that BAME individuals are less likely to seek care when they needed it”and they are also less likely to speak up if they have concerns about risks in the workplace.
The report further states:“The unequal impact of covid-19…may be explained by a number of factors ranging from social and economic inequalities, racism, discrimination and stigma,”as well as differing risks at work and underlying health conditions.
Data published in the Health Service Journal on BAME deaths from covid-19 highlighted that BAME groups accounted for 21% of NHS staff, but 63% of covid-19 deaths.
Among medical staff, those from BAME backgrounds accounted for 44% of the staff, but 95% of the covid-19 deaths.
These figures are truly shocking, and we cannot shy away from the fact that underlying racism is a key factor in these covid-19 deaths.
During the course of this debate, other colleagues have made the point that the BAME community is also over-represented in other frontline services, leading to more public interaction and exposure to covid-19.
I shall not dwell on that now, but we must also remember those public transport workers, such as Belly Mujinga, who contracted the virus and died.
The Government’s failure to release the second report on time does not inspire confidence that they are serious about taking action.
Action is needed to tackle the inequality among health workers.
Viewed together with the failure of the Government to implement the recommendations of the Lammy review, the Wendy Williams Windrush review and Baroness McGregor-Smith’s review on race in the workplace, we have to wonder whether they have any intention on tackling structural racism at all.
I challenge the Government to prove me wrong.
Implementing the recommendations of the reports in full would be a start, but if the Government truly believe that black lives matter then they will be judged on their actions.",3093

First, let me pay tribute to the hon. Member for Brent Central (Dawn Butler) for her brilliant speech.
I thank her for allowing me to intervene so that I could mention some of the topics on which I now wish to start my own speech.
I was standing in this very spot last night when I started my Adjournment debate by condemning completely the far-right violence that we saw in George Square in Glasgow last night.
The far right targeted a peaceful protest by asylum seekers who were protesting about the living conditions that they have been put in by the Home Office.
Such violence and thuggery must be condemned, and is condemned, by many proud Glaswegians.
There are a number of issues that I have had to deal with on behalf of BAME constituents, which are just plain wrong and which show systematic racism.
The first one I will touch on involves the Foreign Office, which was trying to bring back constituents who were stuck abroad.
When we made the case that these were individuals who needed to be brought back home, who had health issues that needed to be addressed, those individuals were all of a sudden told by the British consulate that they were not British nationals.
Why are they not British nationals?
It is because they were given indefinite leave to remain.
It was quite ridiculous.
Even when the permanent secretary at the Foreign Office told the Foreign Affairs Committee that, yes, they would bring people back home on the basis of their address and where they were resident, consulates were saying that people were not British nationals.
That is something that we really need to address.
I have been working on the matter with the hon. Member for Slough (Mr Dhesi).
I will not revisit my 23-minute address that I made last night on how asylum seekers are treated, but to bundle them into vans and place them in hotels, under what is now known as hotel detention, with culturally inappropriate food and no social distancing is, quite frankly, a disgrace.
We also need to deal with the level of asylum support.
A 26p increase in asylum support has been announced by the Government.
That is the equivalent of being given a Freddo bar.
That is what asylum seekers are being asked to live on in a week.
It is an absolute disgrace.
What they are being paid is 42% of what someone would expect on social security.
I completely echo the comments of my friend the Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, the right hon. Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms), on the issue of no recourse to public funds.
He has done a great job on that.
He embarrassed the Prime Minister, who did not seem to have a clue about that.
I want to touch on how public services are dealing with risk assessments and with BAME employees in particular.
We have seen industrial disputes fairly recently, including here in London, in the Foreign Office, with BAME workers going on strike for not being paid the London living wage.
It is an absolute disgrace that a Government Department has allowed a contractor to deal with that, and we really need to deal with equality impact assessments properly.
It is no use for Governments to say that they have carried out an equality impact assessment and have come to the conclusion that everybody is being hammered equally, so there is therefore equality in the system.
That really is not good enough.
Frankly, at times I think the Government ignore their duties on equality impact assessments and the public sector equality duty.
I hope that Members will sign early-day motion 596, on the “Dying for sick pay” campaign, led by the right hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), which particularly relates to how BAME employees—predominantly female BAME employees—are being dealt with in the workforce.
I also hope Members will sign early-day motion 599 on the Scottish Trades Union Congress’s “Break the race ceiling” campaign.
In closing, we need positive action in this country.
As secretary of Show Racism the Red Card, I say that we need to use our education system to eliminate racism in this country.
I was delighted to see the National Football League having to do a U-turn, forced by NFL players and NFL black players.
That shows that action can work.",4337
2020-06-18,Covid-19: BAME Communities,c1041.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25310,Helen Hayes,Labour,Shadow Minister (Cabinet Office),0,"I start by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Brent Central (Dawn Butler) on securing this very important debate this afternoon.
Coronavirus has laid bare many inequalities in the UK that have been growing and deepening during 10 years of austerity.
Racial inequality is central among them.
That was clear from the earliest announcements of coronavirus deaths among NHS staff, all of whom were BAME.
It was clear from the deaths of comparatively younger people, such as the rapper Ty Chijioke, aged 47, who touched so many lives in Brixton in my constituency and across the music world, that coronavirus was having disproportionate impacts.
It is also the case that there are existing long-standing racial inequalities in physical and mental health and high numbers of BAME staff working in frontline occupations in the NHS, social care and transport in particular, where exposure to coronavirus is increased.
That this pandemic would have disproportionate impacts on BAME communities could therefore have been anticipated, yet the Government undertook no equalities-based risk assessments at all to enable increased risk to be mitigated, and it took three months for a Public Health England report to be published.
It simply confirmed what so many people already knew, but offered no recommendations or actions to address it.
When tragic deaths have been reported, including that of Belly Mujinga, who died after she was spat at while working at Victoria station, the response has been completely tone-deaf.
British Transport police initially chose to close the investigation into Belly Mujinga’s death after the suspect tested negative for coronavirus, ignoring the fact that infected or not, spitting is assault, ignoring evidence that Belly had told her employer about underlying health conditions and had asked for mitigation measures, and ignoring evidence that she had not been provided with adequate PPE.
There was an opportunity to highlight increased risks, to show empathy and understanding of the fear and anxiety that so many BAME workers are suffering, to remind employers of their duty of care and to specify steps that should have been taken, but that was entirely missed.
In responding to the Public Health England report, the Government have shown absolutely no urgency.
There have been many, many reports, commissions and studies into the health inequalities suffered by BAME communities, and many, many reports on racial inequalities more widely, from Lord Macpherson to Wendy Williams to the Lammy review.
We do not need more analysis and prevarication, nor do we need another report that will sit on a shelf.
Still less do we need a report written by someone who does not acknowledge the existence of institutional racism.
We need urgent action to protect BAME workers from exposure to coronavirus now.
Where are the Government’s instructions to hospitals, social care providers or transport providers on the steps they need to take to keep their BAME frontline staff safe?
Where is the guidance on risk assessments, PPE and working protocols for employers?
Where are the sanctions for employers who fail to act?
The racial inequalities of coronavirus do not stop at health.
As many schools have reopened in recent weeks, headteachers in my constituency tell me that their BAME students are disproportionately staying at home, often because their parents are very fearful of the increased risks they face from coronavirus and are anxious to avoid infection—yet there is no recognition of that increased risk in the resources provided to schools.
That risks a health inequality resulting in educational inequality.
For far too long, racial inequality and racism in the UK has been ignored and, in some cases, perpetuated by the Government, including very directly by this Prime Minister.
It is evident in education, where our children are still taught a partial, incomplete and dishonest version of British history which bypasses the contribution that people from all over the world have made to our country’s story.
It is evident in an immigration system that was unable to recognise as British thousands of Windrush citizens who had built their lives here for decades.
It is evident in the over-representation of black men in the criminal justice system and in the disproportionality of stop and search.
It is evident in low pay, insecure work and poor housing.
It is evident in the pitiful proportion of BAME people in senior leadership roles in so many settings.
The consequences of this Government’s complacency and negligence on racial inequality and racism have ultimately proved to be deadly.
I hope that the Minister, in responding to the debate, will announce details of the urgent, immediate actions that will be taken to stop preventable BAME coronavirus deaths.
Black lives matter because each life is a loved one with hopes, dreams and aspirations.
Put simply, race should never be a factor for increased risk of death.
That this is the case at all should be a source of national shame.",3442

Member for Brent Central (Dawn Butler) to catch up on it, because that would be very worthwhile.
It was a really interesting and informative speech.
I have been self-certifying.
The fact that I am here is an indication of how strongly I feel about this subject matter.
I speak as the SNP’s women and equalities spokes- person in Westminster, as the MP for Glasgow North East—one of the most ethnically diverse constituencies in Scotland—and as an ally.
I have no illusion: I will not and should not be leading a campaign against racism; I should be supporting those who experience racism.
That is not me, and it is never going to be me.
This report has brought into sharp focus the institutional racism that exists on these islands, so race and racism are what I want to look at.
I will focus on three main things.
First, I will say something about Scotland, the SNP and race.
Secondly, I want to look back in time and cover a bit of history.
The third and final thing I will talk about is what I am going to do about it, how I am going to be an ally and how I am going to support BAME leaders in the fight against racism.
Starting with Scotland and the SNP, here are the good bits.
The SNP Government and Parliament clearly stood last week in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.
The SNP Government have put equality and human rights at the heart of their response to coronavirus, and Nicola Sturgeon today announced further analysis of the impact on people from BAME communities in Scotland.
The hon. Member for Edinburgh West (Christine Jardine) is not in her place, but she mentioned the National Records of Scotland figures.
So far, the Scottish Government have looked at figures for those who are very sick with covid-19 and in hospital, and an expansion of that was announced today.
The SNP provided the first Muslim Member of the Scottish Parliament, the late, great Bashir Ahmad; I cannot look at my colleagues here, because we will all get emotional.
Political leaders in Scotland have long spoken positively and often about migrant communities in Scotland, and that has an impact on the population.
They did it when it was not popular to do it, but it does rub off on the population, and this Government might want to take note of that.
I turn now to the not-so-good bits.
As a party, we have not built on Bashir Ahmad’s legacy.
We have one BAME Member of the Scottish Parliament: Humza Yousaf.
He is the Justice Secretary, and he is doing a brilliant job.
But even he, speaking in the Black Lives Matter debate in the Scottish Parliament last week, checked his own privilege and noted that there are no BAME women in the Scottish Parliament.
That is odd, because I know so many who would do a fantastic job in that Parliament.
He did that in a very honest speech, in which he also listed all the areas of public life where white people are at the top—I am struggling to think of one where they were not—and I was absolutely horrified.
Humza Yousaf also recently ordered a public inquiry into the death of Sheku Bayoh, whose family have waited five years to know how he died in police custody, and he instructed the inquiry to look at whether race played a part.
Sheku’s family should not have had to wait five years for that inquiry to be announced, so we do have things that we have to face up to in Scotland.
Looking to the future, I feel a little more positive than I once did.
A week ago last Monday, the SNP’s black, Asian and minority ethnic convenor organised a Zoom meeting.
At two days’ notice, 127 BAME people signed up for it, 22 SNP MPs—we only invited SNP MPs, so do not worry; we are not competing—12 SNP MSPs and 12 councillors.
That was at two days’ notice, and our job was to listen.
We were not allowed to speak other than to say our names.
Our job was to listen to everybody and hear what they had to say, and we will be building on that—or they will be building on that, and we will be supporting.
I wish to look a little at the history, which I talked about.
There are a number of petitions and campaigns about teaching black history in schools.
I have long supported that—in fact, I have spoken about it in this place—and I will explain why.
I am confident that this is one very significant way to eradicate racism.
Children are not born racist, and when they first become aware of it they find it very difficult to understand.
It is not their instinct to be racist, and then they are taught it.
If they go through nursery and school with positive role models from all ethnicities, and if their school books reflect those positive role models, they are far less likely to be able to be taught to be racist.
I have spoken to teachers who care deeply about this matter who told me that schools already teach about racism, as they should, but it others people and it portrays those classmates as victims.
That is not to say that people are not victims of racism, but there is so much more that we could be doing to stop it in the first place.
One of those things is looking at a positive role models in history and demonstrating that the ethnicity of the people who built these islands and this world is many and varied.
One of them, whom I talk about a lot and who now has a statue across the road, is Mary Seacole.
The third and final thing that I want to cover—
Oh, I have more time than I thought, so actually I will talk about positive images.",5085

I was told I had seven minutes.
Right, I had better come on to: what am I going to do about it?
First, I have applied to have my constituency office registered and trained as a third-party hate crime reporting centre.
I will very briefly say that the first of my colleagues to come back to me and say, “I want to do that too,” was the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Amy Callaghan).
I think all Members will join me in wishing her well as she recovers from what happened last week.
Secondly, I have set up the all-party parliamentary group on unconscious bias.
Our inaugural meeting will be on 29 June.
Members will decide what happens, but my intention is to have a number of distinct investigations.
They could be into a number of things, but the first must be into race.
I want the group to take evidence from people not necessarily about overt racism but about undercover racism, where even the person doing it does not know that they are doing it.
It is not just about hearing evidence.
I want to make recommendations on what we can do to enable people to recognise their own thinking and to undo it—who should be doing that, and how they should be doing it.
I want a UK-wide campaign of awareness, but I should not get carried away and pre-empt the findings.
I thank the hon. Member for Brent Central for agreeing to be part of that APPG.
The third thing that I will do is keep listening, and listening more to people who experience racism, which, as I said, is not me.
I will end on three very brief messages for the Minister and the Government.
The first is that Black Lives Matter is not just about saving those lives, but the lives that people are leading when they are here.
Secondly, please stop using the Lammy review as a cover.
I am sick of hearing the Government answer every question about what they are doing with: “We’ve got the Lammy review.”
They should act upon it, and speak about it only when they have actually done something about it.
Finally, we can breathe and until we cannot we should fight racism and call it out wherever we see it, and whoever it is from—and that includes Prime Ministers.",2017
2020-06-18,Covid-19: BAME Communities,c1045.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25579,Rosena Allin-Khan,Labour,Shadow Minister (Mental Health),0,"I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Brent Central (Dawn Butler) for bringing this important debate to the House.
I also thank my colleagues who have made such vital contributions today: my hon. Friends the Members for Slough (Mr Dhesi) and for Bethnal Green and Bow (Rushanara Ali) spoke so movingly about the heartbreaking loss of loved ones; and my hon. Friends the Members for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood), for Poplar and Limehouse (Apsana Begum), for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy) and for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) rightly raised the important issue of poor-quality housing.
The need for actions, not words, and an end to pointless reports was raised eloquently by my hon. Friends the Member for Bradford West (Naz Shah), for West Ham (Ms Brown), for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah), for Vauxhall (Florence Eshalomi) and for Liverpool, Riverside (Kim Johnson); and the importance of acknowledging the negative effects of covid-19 and discrimination on the mental health of BAME people was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen (Tracy Brabin), my right hon. Friend the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn) and my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford South (Sam Tarry).
The poverty experienced by our BAME communities due to Government policies was perfectly highlighted by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms) and my hon. Friends the Members for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) and for Coventry South (Zarah Sultana); and my hon. Friends the Members for Enfield, Southgate (Bambos Charalambous) and for Dulwich and West Norwood (Helen Hayes) reminded us of our reliance on those from our BAME communities in our NHS.
The resounding message is clear: our BAME communities are grieving.
The priority from the outset of this pandemic should have been to save lives—all lives—but it pains me to have to stand here and state the most obvious point, which has, regrettably, been missed: that no one life is more important than any other.
The Government have liked to describe the fight against coronavirus as a war; to use their analogy, our BAME communities would have been the cannon fodder.
These people’s lives are not, and should not have been, dispensable.
It truly amazes me that in 2020 lives are not valued equally here in the UK, and the covid-19 crisis has shone a much needed spotlight on this stark and most harsh of realities.
It is simply an outrage that people of Bangladeshi and Pakistani heritage have a 100% greater risk of dying from covid-19 than white British people.
The stats are no better for those of Afro-Caribbean descent.
The first 10 doctors to die in the UK from coronavirus were all from BAME backgrounds.
If I may, I wish to take some time to honour just a few of the victims of this virus: Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, a child aged 13; Sudhir Sharma and his daughter Pooja Sharma; Nadir Nur, a London bus driver; Belly Mujinga, a station worker at Victoria station, just down the road; Esther Akinsanya, a nurse who died in the intensive care unit at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where she had worked for more than 20 years; and Dr Fayez Ayache, who aged 76 was still working as a GP—yesterday I had the true honour of talking to his daughter, Layla, who described how her father loved working for the NHS so much because it brought people together, gave a freedom that some have never experienced before and gave hope and light to those who were wandering a darkened path.",907
2020-06-18,Covid-19: BAME Communities,c1046.1,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25579,Rosena Allin-Khan,Labour,Shadow Minister (Mental Health),0,"I thank my hon. Friend for her articulate and eloquent intervention.
I agree that our BAME communities must never be an afterthought and deserve to have everything in place to keep them safe, just as we prioritised other members of our community.
I am proud to stand shoulder to shoulder on the frontline of our NHS, where I proudly work alongside doctors, nurses, cleaners, porters and carers from all backgrounds.
Those on the frontline have made huge sacrifices during this pandemic, but far too many have made the ultimate sacrifice and paid for their service with their lives.
The health and care workforce in England are significantly over-represented by people from BAME groups.
These are jobs that cannot be done from home, and they have been front and centre of the response to covid-19.
Can the Minister please outline whether risk assessments will be developed for BAME key workers exposed to a large section of the general public?
It is not just those on the frontline of our NHS paying the price; it is our bus drivers, our posties, our station attendants, our shop workers, our refuse collectors—the very people who have kept our supermarket shelves stocked and cleaned our streets so that we can safely socially distance.
They must not be forgotten.
We need action from the Government, not simply words.
The issue of flagrant inequality cannot be kicked into the long grass by the Government any longer.
It would dishonour the memory of those who have sadly lost their lives.
Unfortunately, the reality for many of these frontline workers is that they were doing the jobs that nobody else wants to do.
Let us be perfectly clear: there was no option to work from home for these staff and they could not afford not to go to work; they could not risk losing their jobs, for how would they feed their families?
So many BAME people are in insecure work and have to carry on with unsafe practices for fear of the repercussions, afraid to speak out—and it has cost them their lives.
The bullying of BAME people in the workforce is rife and concerns were so often dismissed that staff felt that they could not raise the issue of inadequate provision of PPE.
The BMA has even stated that BAME doctors are twice as likely not to raise concerns for fear of recrimination.
Does the Minister agree that it is simply unacceptable that cleaners were being sent to clean the rooms of people who had died of covid-19 without adequate PPE?
When we discuss the disproportionately high number of BAME deaths, it is vital that the discourse does not fall into pseudoscience and biological difference.
I am a doctor with a public health master’s degree.
To be clear: it is not simply about people from a BAME background having different receptors in their lungs.
People from BAME backgrounds are not a homogenous group of people.
We are talking about people with vastly different heritage and racial backgrounds.
Other countries have got this virus in check.
The risk faced by BAME communities here in the UK is down to structural racism and the precarious work that people are placed in as a result.
The UK has been a warm and welcoming country for so many, but for others—for too many—it has not.
We cannot ignore the vast number of deaths in our communities and sweep the memories of our loved ones under the rug.
In the early days of the crisis, when communication was crucial, why did the Government not reach out to BAME communities?
Can the Minister explain that?
Why were vital documents not translated so that public health advice could be easily disseminated into some of our most vulnerable communities?
How will that change going forward?
The Government’s overlooking of our BAME communities has categorically and catastrophically cost lives.
The hurt and pain brought to the fore during the crisis cannot be forgotten.
I will never forget standing at the bedside of patients, holding a phone to their ear, as they said their last goodbyes to their loved ones.
Those tears, that sound—it never leaves you.
It must not be forgotten.
We are proudly here today standing shoulder to shoulder with our friends, our families, our communities who have been deeply affected by this pandemic, and it is a scandal that the Government blocked a review that included recommendations that could have helped to save BAME lives during this crisis.
What message does that send about how the Government value them?
If, as a country, we truly want to learn from this crisis and treat everyone as equal, we must tackle racism wherever we come across it, and it is everyone’s responsibility, regardless of skin colour, ethnicity or socio-economic status—it is everyone’s problem.
Our BAME communities have been failed and need to be able to trust that we here in this Chamber, in Parliament, truly represent them.
It is our duty to rebuild the trust that has been lost.
The pandemic has so brutally stripped humanity of its ability to breathe.
It is time for the Government to inject humanity and true equality into all their policies.
The time to act is now.",4859

I join him in sending our condolences to the families and friends of those who died or were injured in Reading on Saturday.
This was a truly appalling attack, and I extend our thanks to the police officers and members of the public who showed incredible bravery in response.
I spoke to my hon. Friend the Member for Reading East (Matt Rodda) at the weekend and I am sure that I speak for the whole House in saying to the people of Reading that we stand with them at this incredibly difficult time.
When I was elected leader of the Labour party, I said that I would offer“constructive opposition, with the courage to support the Government”—[Official Report, 22 April 2020; Vol. 675, c. 41.]where they are doing the right thing.
We will, of course, scrutinise the details of the announcement and study the guidance, and there are obviously a number of questions that need to be answered, but overall I welcome the Prime Minister’s statement.
I believe that the Government are trying to do the right thing, and in that we will support them.
There are no easy decisions to be made here.
Any unlocking carries risks.
It has to be phased, managed and carefully planned; it needs to be based on scientific evidence, properly communicated and accompanied by robust track and trace systems; and there must be support for local councils and communities to respond quickly and decisively if there are any fresh outbreaks.
But there are risks of inaction as well—of keeping businesses and schools closed, of keeping our economy closed, and of keeping families apart.
We all need to recognise that today.
I have a number of questions about the basis for these decisions, which I hope the Prime Minister will address in a constructive way.
First, on the scientific evidence, I listened carefully to what he said about the 2-metre rule and the 1-metre rule.
Can he assure the House that the package of measures is agreed by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser?
What assessment has been made of the overall impact on transmission of the virus and on the R rate, both nationally and regionally?
On preventing a second spike and reintroducing measures as needed, the Prime Minister knows that local authorities will have to be central to that, but they need the resources and the powers.
What additional support is he providing to councils?
What new powers for swift local lockdown will be needed should there be a spike in infections?
On protection of those working, particularly on the frontline, we all want people to go back to work, but it has to be safe and standards have to be enforced.
What enforceable measures will the Prime Minister put in place to give confidence to those who are returning to work?
On support for businesses, these changes are necessary, but they will be complex.
Many businesses have already spent thousands of pounds preparing to operate at 2 metres.
These changes will particularly be felt by small businesses and those on the high street, so what support can be given to them to address that?
On schools, I do think that it is safe for some children to return.
I completely support that; the question is how quickly we can get all children back to school safely, the sooner the better.
It was the Education Secretary who told the House on 9 June that it would not be possible to bring all children back to school before the summer.
One of the reasons we support today’s announcement is that it will make it more possible, and easier, to get children back to school more quickly.
We will support that, and my offer to work with the Prime Minister on that stands.
Finally, on test, track and trace, the Prime Minister will know that we have very serious concerns about the gaps in the current system, including the absence of an app.
Getting this right is essential to unlocking in a safe manner, and it is important that the Prime Minister clarifies when the full track, trace and isolate system will be in place.
Today is an important step in the fight against this virus.
We will scrutinise the detail, and we do want more clarity, but we welcome the thrust of the statement.",2690

Our thoughts are very much with the family and friends of James Furlong, of Joe Ritchie-Bennett and of David Wails.
We give grateful thanks to all our emergency services for the work that they continue to do.
On this day, we also acknowledge the sad death of Harry Smith, the former political reporter for ITV and Scottish Television.
He will be sadly missed.
I thank the Prime Minister for an advance copy of his statement.
Today’s announcement will be understandably welcomed by many, but for every word of welcome, there must follow words of caution.
The virus has not gone away.
The margins for ensuring it does not take off again remain tight.
Keeping people safe remains the first priority.
We cannot put a price on human life.
China and Germany are right now dealing with spikes in cases as a result of significant outbreaks.
Health officials in South Korea have said they think the country is now experiencing a second wave.
A similar experience here would amount to not just a health disaster, but an economic disaster.
It would wipe out all the hard-won progress and self-sacrifice over recent months.
It is vital that our collective efforts remain focused on preventing the disaster of a second spike.
We must remain cautious, too, because the public are well used to hearing grand announcements from the Prime Minister, only for a U-turn to follow days or weeks later.
Not only have the UK Government wasted precious time on introducing a botched test and trace system, but they have wasted millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money in the process.
That is why it is essential that the next steps are directed solely by the science, rather than political pressures.
Can he confirm, therefore, that he will publish not just the conclusions but the full review on social distancing measures and the scientific advice given?
We know that a review of quarantining measures following foreign travel was due next week.
Will the Prime Minister confirm that the introduction of any air bridges will be based on public health assessments, not economic assessments?
Can he also confirm that the devolved Governments will be closely involved and party to any arrangements with any country on air bridges?
Finally, to maintain full clarity, will he reaffirm that the announcements today are solely for England and that the citizens of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland should continue to follow public health advice from their own Governments?",2885

Coronavirus has hit all sectors of the UK economy, some harder than others, and aerospace and air travel will be one of the hardest hit.
I have been here long enough to remember the effects on the industry of 9/11 and the banking crisis.
These were severe, but nothing compared with the challenge that we face today.
For Airbus in Broughton in my seat, this has meant a reduction in production rates of about a third.
Some 40% of the UK workforce in the commercial aircraft division is currently on furlough.
About 500 employees at Broughton have been working on the ventilator programme.
I am sure everyone here and everyone in the country will be extremely grateful and proud that that has happened.
It demonstrates what a dedicated workforce we have, but their reward for this work, as the programme comes to an end, is that many of them will not qualify for furlough.
I think that that is an absolute disgrace.
I would ask the Minister to really look at this situation.
It cannot be right that the people who have done this work do not qualify.
They are a special case and they should be treated as such.
Airbus has stepped in and will cover the furlough, but that is hardly the point.
I ask the Minister to press his Treasury colleagues on this matter urgently.
Industry experts do not expect passenger demand to return to pre-crisis levels before 2023.
That will in turn mean that actual production rates will not catch up until 2025.
With 70% of the value of an aircraft in the supplier chain, the effects there could be devastating, leading to a near total collapse of the sector if intervention does not occur.
If we are serious about maintaining a viable aerospace sector in the UK, we need to be serious and have a strategic plan that embraces not only companies such as Airbus and the airlines, but the supplier chain.
All parts need to work together to that end.
I am concerned that some airlines—well, one in particular—see this crisis as an opportunity to remove rivals and ride roughshod over the terms and conditions of their workforce.
That type of attitude and approach needs to change.
We need a united front to face this crisis.
In the US, Germany and France, we have had announcements of targeted programmes of support.
The latest announcement from the French Government included a raft of measures.
Its aim is to protect some 100,000 jobs.
It includes a reduced working week or working hours, with the difference picked up by the state.
That will last up to two years.
There will be a one-year moratorium on aircraft loans under the export credit agencies, amounting to around €1.5 billion.
In addition, Airbus will have 18 months to pay loans, rather than the six months currently.
That is worth around €2 billion.
Defence procurement projects are also to be brought forward with new investment to help the sector, and the defence sector SME fund will be increased by 50% to €100 million a year.
Air France-KLM has already been given a €7 billion loan guarantee to secure its future.
In addition, the French Government have promised more investment, with €1.5 billion to decarbonise and produce carbon neutral aircraft by 2035, rather than the current target of 2050.
Those are bold plans that look at the medium and long terms.
They recognise that there will be no quick fix, and we in the UK need to rise to that challenge, otherwise we will be left behind and could lose one of our greatest and most important industries.
What can we do to help to secure the future?
We clearly need a job retention support scheme, not just for now and a few more months, but for the long term.
We need to retain skills and we need the flexibility that reduced working hours can offer.
We need to build support for Airbus by speaking to the airlines and retiring older, less efficient aircraft from their fleets.
Around 70 aircraft flown by UK-registered airlines are more than 15 years old.
We need to address the complete mess, as has been mentioned, of quarantine, which has already added to the crisis.
We need to invest in research and development, make advances in R&D tax credits and confirm that funding of the Aerospace Technology Institute will be doubled to £300 million a year.
We need something for the supply chain, because that is in many ways the most vulnerable part of the sector.
We need a long-term policy to ensure that there is an investment fund to keep suppliers alive during this crisis.
We need to bring forward defence projects, but they need to be in this country, not just bought off the shelf from America.
If we do not step up to the plate, the future will not be good.
For Broughton, it is always about securing the next wing.
If we do not secure the next wing and Germany, France or Spain get it, the future will be bleak.
I ask the Government to act and act now before it is too late.",7428

What may have seemed unthinkable to this Government a few short months ago is now not only thinkable but absolutely essential to support UK industries.
The Government’s actions to save jobs through the job retention scheme by allowing workers to be furloughed was universally welcomed, although there were too many gaps in it, which was deeply unfair to workers who fell through those cracks.
But the current plan to reduce support for furloughed workers and self-employed people is sending unemployment soaring.
The plans to cut back on furlough support has seen tens of thousands of jobs lost before our eyes: 9,000 jobs at Rolls-Royce; 10,000 jobs at BP; 5,000 jobs at Centrica; 10,000 jobs at British Airways; more than 3,000 jobs at Virgin Atlantic; 2,600 jobs at OVO Energy; 2,500 jobs at Travis Perkins—I literally do not have time to go through the thousands of jobs that are being lost.
The whole point of the job retention scheme was to save jobs—an aim that we can all support—but if the furlough support is withdrawn too early, it will have failed in that goal.
In addition, Government loans need to be converted into grants to save our businesses.
I first petitioned the Chancellor on this issue on 15 April in a letter to which I still await a response.
The guiding principle here must be to save businesses, jobs and our economy.
We are very far from “job done”.
The Bank of England has said that the UK Government should treat the debt that has been incurred as war debt.
That is absolutely correct.
It should not lead to greater austerity, because that will only compound the challenges that we currently face.
A war has indeed been fought—a war on our health and our economy—and the Government must continue to throw every mechanism and tool at their disposal at securing victory as we face the worst economic depression in more than 300 years.
UK Government borrowing will reach £340 billion and quantitative easing will reach £645 billion this year, so why has Scotland been allocated a relatively meagre £10 billion?
While the UK Government borrow and Scotland is sold short, the powers, levers and financial flexibility that Scotland has are insufficient to manage Scotland’s response to the host of challenges that we face.
With the requisite powers in Scotland, we could do it better for ourselves, as we always do.
The current powers do not allow us to do that.
We need to be armed to face the economic tsunami that is heading our way at great speed.
If this Government will not do more, we in Scotland need more power to do it for ourselves.",1998

It now stands at barely 9%.
If there is to be any serious agenda for levelling up in this country, we need a modern manufacturing renaissance to close the gap between the regions, to rebalance between services and manufacturing, and to be a country that is actually exporting again, which has a massive impact on our balance of trade.
We need steel to be at the heart of that modern manufacturing renaissance.
Steel is the backbone of manufacturing.
It is in the cars that we drive, the offices we work in, even in the cutlery we use to eat our meals.
It is at the heart of our aerospace and automotive sectors.
It is absolutely vital as a foundation industry.
The Port Talbot steelworkers in my constituency make the best steel that money can buy.
It is green steel.
Imagine relying on steel from China, which has some of the dirtiest steel production processes in the world.
Allowing our steel sector to collapse would be the definition of a false economy, in terms of the need for a proper industrial strategy and the reduction of our dependence on China.
Steel is the beating heart of the economy and community, with 4,000 well-paid steelworkers in my Aberavon constituency.
Some say that steel is a sunset industry.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
It is vital in photovoltaic cell production, and the vast majority of the alloys that are used in steel these days did not even exist 10 years ago.
It is at the cutting edge of innovation.
Tata Steel is in the midst of a cash-flow crisis because of the impact of covid-19, which has caused demand for steel to fall off a cliff.
It needs Government-backed loan support.
I do not care whether that is a loan or Project Birch; it does not matter.
We need support from Government so that the steel industry can weather the storm and help us to build back better.
There can be no post-pandemic economic recovery without a strong and healthy steel industry.
Imagine the cost of doing nothing—4,000 well-paid workers going on to benefits.
The capital expenditure costs of decommissioning the Port Talbot steelworks would be astronomical.
The loan would be far better value for the taxpayer than the cost of doing nothing.
I urge the Government to step up to the plate.
I urge the Government to take the long view and put in place an industrial strategy that includes energy prices, business rates and a proper trade defence mechanism, so we stop the dumping of Chinese steel.

The first is one that other Members have touched on.
There are 3 million small limited companies, from taxi drivers to people in the creative industries, who still are being excluded from Government rescue measures.
Many of those are not eligible for universal credit, so I add my plea to that of others: please, please, can the Government try to help those people?
The second point I want to make is about tourism.
It occurs to me that I shall be repeating myself, inasmuch as I talked about this very subject some two or three weeks ago, although, now I think about it, I was up on the screens all around the Chamber—not a very pleasant sight, I fancy, so perhaps I should take the opportunity to apologise for any trauma I caused to right hon. and hon. Members.
It has been an incredibly long winter in the highlands of Scotland, and it is not over yet.
We hope that the tourism businesses will go back in business on 15 July, but they are by their very nature seasonal.
They make their money during the tourism season to survive the winter.
That is the fat that they live on to see them through to the next tourism season, and I fear very much that many of the tourism businesses in my constituency, even starting on 15 July, will not put enough cash in the bank to see them through.
Of course, if they go down and they fail, the following year we have a reduced tourism product to offer people to bring them back to the highlands of Scotland.
The same is true of Anglesey; it is true all over the UK.
Our tourism product must be safeguarded and garnered and encouraged.
I know from what I have said in the past that I have the support of right hon. and hon. Members in all parts of this House on this issue, and I am grateful for that.
My hon. Friend and colleague the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron) has indeed been talking about this matter, and I support him.
I also know that within the Scottish Government Fergus Ewing, the Minister responsible, is big on this as well.
I guess my plea is this: I believe, as does my hon. Friend, that we will have to have some specially tailored package, based on the measures that the Government have rightly put in place at the moment, to try to help the tourism industry through the longer period.
I do not know what the answer is, but there are very many clever people who work in Her Majesty’s Treasury, and perhaps something could be thought up about that.
I hope there will be discussions between the Scottish Government and Fergus Ewing, and Her Majesty’s Treasury and appropriate Ministers.
I would be deeply grateful if this issue could be taken seriously, because if tourism goes down the tubes in my constituency, frankly, the economy will be damaged irreparably.
That means people will lose their livelihoods and the curse of the highland clearances could come back to haunt us yet again.",1522

My constituents have been in touch with me about this issue more than any other during the crisis.
The crisis has revealed the complexity of the UK economy.
It is a feature of our country’s creativity, energy and innovativeness that we host such a vast array of industries and businesses within our island nation.
That is reflected in the myriad ways that people earn a living.
I am a member of the Public Accounts Committee, and we were taken aback at a recent hearing to find that the Government’s preparation for a pandemic did not include preparation for its economic impact.
That left the Treasury with the huge task of devising and delivering its economic rescue plans when the lockdown started, and I pay tribute to it for what it was able to achieve in such a short period.
As many Members on both sides of the House have pointed out, the job retention scheme—the furlough scheme—has been invaluable in supporting household incomes during this extremely difficult time.
But it is clear that support was focused on those who earn salaries and pay mortgages, and, tragically, many sectors and workers were missed out.
I urge the Minister to consider the lessons for future lockdown planning, although we all hope that this will not be necessary in the immediate future.
The biggest tragedy is that many of those who missed out are the ones who will be most instrumental in rebuilding the economy in the months to come—our small businesses, our entrepreneurs, our freelancers, those who have taken a risk on a new business idea or taken on a new job.
The Government must focus their investment on our key industries and those that will take the longest to recover.
I spoke earlier today in this place about the necessity of supporting theatres, and I extend that to the whole creative sector.
Not only are they a huge earner for us abroad, but they reflect British values across the globe and are instrumental in so many ways.
Beyond that, for all of us who have spent months staring at our laptop screens, it will be essential to enjoy live music and live theatre again.
I spoke earlier about the necessity of using education programmes, which theatre companies and other parts of the creative sector are so good at, to engage our young people once again.
My hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Jamie Stone) spoke passionately about the tourism and hospitality sector, and it is essential that we support all these industries through the next few months.
We do not just need to support our workers in these industries; we need to plot out a strategy for their survival and recovery.
If the right people get the right help now, they will be ready to revive the economy as soon as they are able to.",1753
2020-06-25,Covid-19: Support for UK Industries,a1559.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25919,Richard Thomson,Scottish National Party,Shadow SNP Spokesperson (Business and Industry),0,"This is a timely debate that has not just highlighted the concerns of those who have put their names to these petitions but will have widespread resonance far beyond them.
We have heard many excellent contributions this afternoon, with concerns raised covering a wide spectrum of sectors, including arts, tourism, childcare, events, aviation and steel—a full sweep of the economy—and enterprises of all sizes.
The UK Government package, as the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Anthony Browne) said, was put together at speed, and as we have heard, many significant gaps have been identified.
On the furlough scheme, for example, I need not dwell on the pivotal date of 19 March, which has left far too many people reliant on the good will of former employers if they are to benefit from it.
The self-employed support scheme, which was unveiled after this House had broken up for the Easter recess, missed out those who were newly self-employed.
Directors also missed out if they were remunerated through dividends.
This makes the case, I think, for a universal basic income so that we know who everyone is, and if we give them the money to get through, then nobody, by definition, will have fallen through the cracks.
Much of the support has been based on the rateable values of business enterprises, and I can understand exactly why that is.
It is clear and it is simple for local authorities to administer, but it has still left too many businesses missing out, because they were outside the relevant rateable value bands or they were not in the relevant sector, or because they were small businesses operating out of people’s homes and were therefore not on the business valuation roll.
The Scottish Government have certainly done all they can to try to plug those gaps in support with a £2.3 billion package of support.
That has meant relief to the fish processing sector and to airports, support for the creative sector, plugging that gap in support for the newly self-employed, £78 million for construction and £51 million to support early-stage, high-potential companies.
In all, the response amounts to over £4 billion for tackling this, when we have had £3.8 billion coming through the normal Treasury route.
However, it is important to note that the Scottish Government cannot do everything, and in trying to do more, they are finding themselves seriously constrained not only by the resource available, but by the constitutional limits placed on devolution, which have been particularly exposed in this crisis, and no more so than over borrowing powers.
The borrowing powers that the Scottish Parliament has are designed to deal with cash-flow mismatches from year to year; they are not there to deal with serious amounts of investment for the future.
I understand that the Finance Secretary in Scotland, Kate Forbes, has written today to the Chancellor to ask for greater flexibility around that.
I hope she gets a reply that is not only swift but favourable.
This has also shown the limitations of the so-called Barnett consequentials.
Too often, colleagues in Edinburgh have been left waiting to find out exactly how much is going to come through from spending decisions that have been taken in this place, occasionally finding that the money they thought was coming through was then not.
It would be much better if the devolved Governments were able to decide what response they wanted to make and muster the resources at their disposal in the shortest possible time by simply having the powers to do so without reference to anywhere else.
I appreciate that we are short of time this afternoon, but I will say that borrowing powers were one of the key items identified in the report created by the Scottish Government’s advisory group on economic recovery, led by Benny Higgins.
Borrowing powers were part of that, as was a series of 25 recommendations including a full review of the fiscal framework, jobs guarantees for the under-25s, prioritising a green recovery and a revised partnership between business and Government.
These are all important structural changes in the economy that we absolutely need to have if we are going to make sure that the new normal is better than the old normal.
In the time remaining, let me just make a plea for the energy sector.
Oil, gas and energy are absolutely crucial not just for jobs in the north-east of Scotland, but right across the UK.
They are crucial if we are to maintain our energy security and effect the transition to net zero, but it is an industry on the brink of thousands upon thousands of job losses.
The Scottish Government have invested £62 million to do what they can to assist in that.
We desperately need a sector deal.
Together with my hon. Friends the Members for Aberdeen North (Kirsty Blackman) and for Aberdeen South (Stephen Flynn), I have made a plea to the Chancellor for just such a sector deal.
Again, we hope for a swift and favourable response.
In conclusion, the support to date from the UK Government has been very welcome where it has landed, but desperately missed where it has not.
All too often, it has failed to land.
The economic challenges we face as the crisis evolves give us a new landscape.
The challenges change, but are no less urgent and much remains to be done.
I say to the Minister that if the UK Government are not willing to use the powers they have to address those shortcomings and to tackle the additional issues that need to be tackled, they should devolve those powers to Governments elsewhere in these islands who will use them.",3883
2020-06-25,Covid-19: Support for UK Industries,a1561.0,uk.org.publicwhip/person/25379,Matthew Pennycook,Labour,"Shadow Minister (Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy)",0,"It is a pleasure to respond to this wide-ranging and well-subscribed debate on behalf of the Opposition.
I start by thanking all right hon. and hon. Members who have taken part in the debate today, and the right hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Theresa Villiers) for opening it.
I also pay tribute to the initiators of each of the petitions under consideration and, by my calculation, the nearly three quarters of a million people who collectively signed them for making today’s debate possible.
As numerous right hon. and hon. Members referred to in their remarks, the debate takes place in the midst of a pandemic that is taking a severe toll on our economy.
Barring a second wave of the virus, the worst may now be behind us, but the fiscal impact wrought, the dramatic rise in the unemployment rate and the prospect of many sectors continuing to operate at reduced capacity for some time point to the trials that lie ahead.
Let me underline for the record that the Opposition welcomed the unprecedented measures that the Government took, in essence, to put our economy on life support in the face of a near total shutdown.
The fact that we are here today debating urgent petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of people working in a range of industries is testament to the need to further refine those measures and build on them where necessary to protect as many people’s incomes, jobs and businesses as we can.
In the time available to me, I will pick up on three points that have been prominent during the debate.
The first is the need for further improvements to the measures already introduced to support businesses and individuals.
The second is the need for support packages for certain UK industries, tailored to their needs.
The third is the need for a more strategic approach to the recovery than that which defined the rescue.
On the first of those points, the House needs no reminding that it is people who are the bedrock of the productive capacity that firms, and thereby industries, will need to bounce back now that the immediate crisis is subsiding.
That is why we must continue to do what is necessary to protect their livelihoods, their jobs and their businesses through this difficult period.
That is why we continue to press the Government to fix the gaps and deficiencies in the various financial support schemes that have already been established.
There is still time to do so.
There is still time for the Government to revise the job retention scheme to cover employees currently shut out from it, and still time to revise the self-employment income support scheme to help those it currently excludes.
There is still time to further reform the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme, so that more companies can access finance and liquidity easily to make it through the crisis, as well as access more patient capital.
There is still time—this brings me to my second point—to revisit the one-size-fits-all approach that has underpinned the design of many of those schemes and appears to be dictating the Government’s approach to sectors and industries across the board.
The various case studies raised by right hon. and hon. Members from all parts of the House are a vivid illustration that the pandemic’s economic impact has not been felt uniformly across different sectors, but also that the rate at which sectors can reopen and restart will differ markedly.
If we are to successfully navigate the next phase of this crisis, logic dictates that a more differentiated approach is needed.
Such an approach will undoubtedly pose challenges for the Government, but if Ministers do not concede that established schemes will have to be redesigned so that they can enable a flexible sector-by-sector response, and if they do not concede that targeted support packages will be needed for the industries most in need, we risk many more firms going under and many more jobs being lost.
There is, however, no real sense that the Government have accepted as much.
Taking three of the industries whose plight is the focus of the petitions we are considering today, the early years sector is under huge pressure, with many providers on the verge of ruin.
As a report released this morning by the Early Years Alliance and Ceeda makes clear, the impact of collapsing relevant revenues from significantly reduced demand and the increased costs that come with making establishments covid-safe are falling on a sector that was already struggling financially before the pandemic took hold.
It looks set to lead to significant funding shortfalls and mass closures.
The industry needs more help.
As many hon. Members referred to in their speeches, not least my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Jeff Smith) and the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), the arts and creative industries, as well as the sectors heavily dependent on them, have been hit particularly hard.
That sector will be one of the last to reopen because of the difficulty—in many cases, the impossibility—of operating theatres, live music, festivals and other events and performance in line with social distancing measures.
The Culture Secretary told the Evening Standard on 8 June that a package of support was “imminent”, yet weeks later nothing has materialised.
That industry desperately needs more help.
In powerful contributions, my right hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami) and my hon. Friends the Members for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell) and for Luton South (Rachel Hopkins) highlighted the fact that the aviation sector stands on the brink of devastation as a result of the pandemic, and several airlines have already announced plans for significant redundancies.
Research from the New Economics Foundation and the TUC earlier this month warned that at least 70,000 jobs in the wider aviation industry are at risk before the end of the summer alone.
The Opposition recognise that aviation must change to tackle runaway global heating, but current developments are chaotic and suggest the absence of any long-term strategy for the industry.
It needs more help, as do so many others.
When the Minister stands up, I hope that he can give the House and all those watching our proceedings an indication of when sector-specific support packages, including access to emergency funding, will be forthcoming for these industries and others that are crying out for help, including hospitality, aerospace, the motor industry and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon (Stephen Kinnock) pointed out powerfully, steel.
If the Minister is unable to do that, will he at least provide some reassurance that the Government recognise the urgency with which such tailored packages are required by the industries in question and that Ministers accept the need to make changes to existing schemes, such as the furlough, so that their phasing out mirrors the pace at which industry is able to return to some semblance of normality?
That brings me to my final point—I will be brief in making it, Madam Deputy Speaker.
As we look to ensure that our industries get the ongoing support that they need, we must plan strategically for the future.
That means support, yes, to ensure that our industries do not fall behind their international competitors in the years ahead, but also support that is designed to achieve other important national objectives, not least responding to the environment and climate emergency.
Our European neighbours are using this crisis as an opportunity to do just that, and the Government should look to match and even surpass their ambition by coming forward with support that will retain and create jobs, accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy and address a range of regional and wider inequalities—a point made very powerfully by my right hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones) and my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Rushanara Ali).
In conclusion, the Opposition recognise the scale of the challenge that the Government have had to confront, as well as the speed with which the current schemes had to be designed and implemented, but, as the OECD made clear, our country is on course to suffer the largest economic hit from the pandemic among major nations this year.
In the face of such an emergency, we on this side of the House and the three quarters of a million people who signed these petitions are not demanding the impossible.
We are simply asking the Government to act decisively and spend smartly to protect industries that contribute so much to our economy and our society, and on whom so many people rely.",4515
